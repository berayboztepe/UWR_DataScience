# Item description:

Neural Networks can be applied to a wide spectrum of tasks, including image and video processing, creating game playing agents, financial data analysis, or even using a computer as a writer, painter or composer. They allow creation of programs that are learned rather than written. This means that instead of implementing a concrete algorithm, the program applies patterns that are automatically found in the data. For example, in computer vision applications, an object detection system can be created by applying a deep neural network directly to the raw image, or processed .

The aim of this course is to present the basics of how neural networks work, both from a more *theoretical* and *practical* point of view. The theoretical part will cover the basics of neural networks, including such architectures as perceptron, multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN).

There will be a focus on applications and good *engineering practices*. The practical part will focus on the implementation of neural networks using the numpy(for good understanding of the linear algebra used in neural networks) and PyTorchlibraries (for better understanding of the neural network implementation). We will also use the Pytorch Lightningframework to simplify the implementation of neural networks.

Additionally, we will cover such topics as:

* style transfer,
* some model interpretability techniques,
* adversarial examples,
* transfer learning,
* some generative models (eg Flow-based models),
