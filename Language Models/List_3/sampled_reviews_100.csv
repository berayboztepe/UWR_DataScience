"Went for lunch and found that my burger was meh.  What was obvious was that the focus of the burgers is the amount of different and random crap they can pile on it and not the flavor of the meat.  My burger patty seemed steamed and appeared to be a preformed patty, contrary to what is stated on the menu.    I can get ground beef from Kroger and make a burger that blows them out of the water."
"I needed a new tires for my wife's car. They had to special order it and had it the next day, I dropped it off in the morning before work and they called a few hours later and the car was ready. It was quick and efficient, and the woman who helped me was awesome."
"Jim Woltman who works at Goleta Honda is 5 stars!! He is knowledgeable, helpful, and so personable.  He did a fantastic job on my Honda.  Thank you Jim!!!  And thank you Honda for having such a fabulous employee!"
Been here a few times to get some shrimp.  They've got a nice selection of different fish.  Prices are decent.  It's great to have a seafood market in the area.
"This is one fantastic place to eat whether you are hungry or just need a good snack.  Everything I had has been very good and the price is always good.  Very friendly staff, clean, pleasant place to visit with friends."
"Dirt cheap happy hour specials.  Half priced drinks.  Not really my crowd.  Lots of college kids on a Saturday night.  On the other hand there were lots of hot girls.  YEAAAHHH buddy!

I'll get to the point.  As hard as they really try to turn this place into a club at nights it will still and always be a tavern.  The bartender was nice but they charged me full price on drinks 5-10 mins before the special ended!  I heard they do that a lot here so be warned."
"Unbelievably poor customer ""service"".  Beyond bad.  They insisted on charging me a large car price to wash my mid-size car.  I was told to go talk to Don Risdon, and when I did, his first reaction was to physically shove me and tell me to get away from him before he really lost his temper.  Can you believe that?  Never in my 50 years have I encountered anything like it.  He would not acknowledge that he was misleading customers by the prices posted at the cash register."
"I walked in the door and was greeted with a welcoming smile. I was offered help in finding a good match for my home. I was told if I didn't like it, they would return my money - no problem.

A very nice experience and fair pricing."
"Nothing beats pizza and beer in my book. This place nails both, with an eye towards sustainability which always makes me feel good. They have a specially brewed beer, and a handful of other craft beers on tap to satisfy almost any taste. I prefer the deep dish, although my accomplice likes the thin crust more. That usually just means leftovers. I wish their appetizers were more adventurous, or changed at all, but I guess don't mess with success and they're a pizza place both apply. 

I just wish they delivered."
Philly cheese steak (loaded)  was phenomenal. Good service and views of Johns Pass. Small seating area. Bacon cheese fries were good to share with group. When I return to area i will come again.
"Went here with my mom a couple weeks ago. We recently went gluten-free, so having Sweet Christine's nearby is a life saver!

I had a donut and a blondie muffin (don't judge!).

The donut wasn't worth it. It was small, awkwardly sweet, weirdly textured.. I just didn't need it in my life. I wouldn't get it again.

The muffin was essentially a chocolate chip muffin. This was the best muffin I've ever had in my life. Now granted, I haven't had muffins in two months, and I LOVE muffins, but having this gluten free option is like a sign from above that God cares about us gluten intolerant folks, too.

I won't be able to go back until July, but when I do, I'm stocking up. I don't care about the price. These muffins are the best."
"The Castle is hands-down one of my favourite midnight institutions/bars/clubs. Everyone here does their own thing and doesn't give a damn what you think (in the best way possible). Most people are dressed to impress, but they're also there to have fun.

I'm usually a Monday or Thursday night kinda guy, preferring more new wave/indie/pop music than some of the harder gothic/industrial music they play on other nights. For those who are somehow still into cobwebs and corsets and fake fangs, there's a plethora of nights for you. Some of my best memories are dancing hard with a hundred strangers surrounding me, puddles of sweat under our feet, and massive cheers in the wee hours of the morning when the lights flick on and they kick everyone out.

Some of the staff/bartenders/dancers seem to take themselves too seriously, preventing this place from the five stars it probably deserves, but that's hit or miss because I've met some fabulous people working at the Castle over the years.

Time keeps marching on, but inside the Castle there's a strange phantasmagorical atmosphere of old punks and goths, 90s subcultures, hipsters, sexual deviants, local celebrities (The Senator and Peter Pan!) and everything in between, marching to the beat of their own drums. Rock on, Castle."
"Dr. Kolarczyk has been ""my guy' for over 20 years. Great Doctor and nice staff. Highly recommended."
"It's almost 10 o clock on a Tuesday and I am tipsy. Hold on to your hats, suburbia!

This place is great! 

About the coolest little eating place/drinking spot around. There it is, all funky-vibed in the middle of Swedesboro. Well then! Cool ceiling fixtures, weird art, crazy chotzkas, dim lighting. (Certain I spelled ""chotzkas"" wrong. Shrug. I'm tipsy.)  You have me titillated. Enthralled. Intrigued. Enraptured. Tipsy. Did I mention tipsy?  Visually fantastic. Super chill.

Draft list? Solid. Lots of local flavors and craft favorites.  We sat at the bar and perused the sweet taps.  Pretty excellent for small town nj. Pretty excellent for old city, philly, too, if you want to compare apples to nowhere-to-park-Philadelphia grapefruit.

Food? Ooookay. Nothing super spectacular, at least from what we sampled. Flatbread pizza? Decent, definitely. Gravy fries? Yum! Nice job. The Pittsburghian Capn was diggin it lots. 

Service? Fab! Happy, attentive waitstaff. 

Overall? Yay! A new happy place. Especially on a Tuesday. Did I mention I'm  tipsy? Will definitely be back. Side note: since the grand move, I live, like, six blocks from here. Perfect walking distance. 

Anyone else in for some Ballast Point Sculpin or Cape May brews?  Cool. We'll stroll. I'm thinking there's more tipsy tuesdays a'comin'!"
"Great ambience and seated quickly after arriving around 8:30 pm. Servers slow on bringing water and ordering food. After waiting over an hour for our food, our waitress said 15-20 more minutes. It was 9:45 at that point and we decided to pay for our drinks and leave. We will wait 6 months before trying again"
"Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight with my husband and another couple. It seemed quaint and the piano player was a nice touch. Bread and olive oil were delicious. The special salad was also good. The men ordered linguini with seafood and both enjoyed it. Priced at $18.50 it was fairly priced. My girlfriend and I both ordered veal - she ordered veal parmigiana and I ordered veal Marsala. Both veal cutlets came out pretty small and dry looking. The veal Marsala was over cooked and dry and so small a portion that my friends and husband kept asking if I had enough to eat. I weigh less than 110 pounds and almost always take home at least half my meal; not tonight. Both veal dishes were $28.75 each which was totally ridiculous for what we received. It was over cooked and hardly any sauce or mushrooms and not hot. I asked for more sauce which I got and that had plenty of mushrooms and was hot. At over $80 per couple, without alcohol, it was totally overpriced and not good."
"Kind of a cool place... it's an old diner converted into a martini bar.

The drinks were good and the wait staff was very kind, but at the end of the day... do you really want to spend $12 per drink to sip martinis in a diner?"
"Great little neighborhood spot for coffee and a Saturday breakfast. Portions are on the small side, and service can be spotty, so don't go with the expectation of a quick meal.

They accept credit cards, but you can't add a tip to the credit card. This is a bit sad since I rarely carry cash and didn't know that leaving a tip on the card was a no-no at this place until I checked out."
Sorry....this place just isn't good. The beer was sub par and our food came out wrong and cold. Somehow our tab came out insanely priced for what he had. With Tired Hands down the street your beer better be on point and it was not. The food could have saved it but sadly it didn't.
"I'm not a fish guy.  Childhood in a fishing village on an island in Puget Sound means I can tell quality, but that I'm generally sick of it.  My girlfriend's father, however, is a don't-take-""no""-for-an-answer type of guy, so we were going to Anastasi for a holiday family celebration.

The whole party was about as disruptive as a four-person table can be in the center of the small dining room, which is bordered by the frozen counters of an indoor fish market (being in the evenings sealed tightly enough that the fishy smell is tolerable and the room keeps warm). The staff up to the owners themselves humored us and attended everything pleasantly and speedily.  The waiter was, not to his great discredit but certainly not toward helping the rowdiness of the situation, a bit of a chummy guy.

The food was so perfectly what it was advertised as and what it should have been, being smack in the middle of the Italian Market, that I'd like to call it ""the comfort food of gourmet.""  I got muscles in white wine sauce over noodles I can't remember how to spell, someone ordered a fish entree which looked great, and two incredibly-cheap lobsters were devoured by the others.  I can't promise they always have cheap lobster, but they do seem like they'd probably always have a randomly seasonally cheap offering of some sort.

The wine was just fine, but I was ordering on my girlfriend's father's credit card, so I didn't try any of their nicer bottles.

Don't come here for food tourism: go get a cheesesteak or something; come here in the day to get authentically good fish and in the evening to eat only if it's an occasion. It was as great as any people could have made it, but it was still a little cold and fishy.  Worth it if you only go out twice a month."
"Just strolling down State St. and smelled some pizza.  Why not make a quick stop for a snack?

The pizza looked good in the rotary oven so we asked for a pepperoni.  Problem was that the guy who pulled our pizza out let the tip rub on the bottom of the oven a little before he handed it to us.  Usually stuff like that doesn't bother me but I took a peek underneath and it was gross.

Fine.  We cut off the diseased tip of the pizza and ate anyway.  Decent texture and taste.  Too expensive for the tiny slice."
"This service was amazing. I got the green tea pedicure. The service was amazing. My pedicure was simply amazing. She filed, cut, shaped, plucked everything that needed it. The hot stone massage to finish it was amazing. The foot massage that came with the pedicure amazing. As I was waiting for my feet to dry they gave me a massage. I highly recommend this nail salon."
"Milk house is a great farm stand. Wide selection of in season produce, flowers and herbs. The farm has free range chickens who supply their eggs. Fresh chickens are available twice a year. Milk house runs on an honor system but also has ability to take credit. Great find."
"Went with two other friends so we were able to get a well rounded taste (what else are friends for!) 
Nice liquor menu,  service and atmosphere was good and for those I'd give it 4 stars.  We even got 3 different kinds of bbq sauce and that's always a mouthwatering treat!  
2 for the meat itself! 
I was disappointed with the taste, texture,  portion.  I expected more meat,  and brisket was overcooked.  (We requested medium rare).   The beans were good though a friend didn't like it.  Honestly,  I don't even remember what else I ate there cuz it wasn't too memorable ha!"
"1.  The sink in the bathroom had something all in.

2. The TV does not have access to any visible channels just the black and white fuzzy screen.

3.  The air condition was not pushing enough air to cool that room at all. Room was hot!

4. The bathroom door does not shut without force."
Love this place!! Service has always been good even on the busy Trivia nights. Haven't had a bad experience! Would've given it t stars but the wings weren't crisp enough great flavor but kind of soggy.
Beer list...beer list...beer list. So what's the best thing about this place? I'm gonna have to say the beer list. Amazing selection. Oh yeah and the food is great too. Wait a minute? I've only been here once? Wait what? I'LL BE BACK
"Sorry folks but I didn't see what is great about this museum.  One of the exhibits talks about Jews following the gold rush west.  Didn't many people?? I liked some of the videos, especially the ones related to WWII and I did learn some new things, like about Jews coming from Brazil...but for the most part it was nothing I didn't already in some sense know.  Seeing what people wore back in the day isn't really Jew-specific.  At least a lot of the clothes on display didn't seem to be Jew specific.  There was an old Torah scroll which was cool but it was a stretch to have Levi jeans on display.  Oy.  I really liked the space and the layout of everything (except the 2nd floor where I got a bit lost in the maze) but that doesn't make the museum itself great.

I also thought it was so lame that they only take credit cards (and run them after sunset) on Saturdays.  I guess they didn't want to lose the revenue for the museum store being closed on Saturdays so they figured out a work around.  Having to buy tickets to the museum on Saturdays in the visitor center is lame and that policy should just be in line with the museum store policy.  I don't mind paying by credit card and having you run it that night."
"This place is  Ridiculous, When dealing with the owner of the 1st time they messed up, They were very apologetic And everything worked out well, called the company once again To use their services We change the time one time, Then their customer service representative accused us of trying to get stuff for free and telling us that they'd never work with us again which is totally ridiculous, Win over and over again something goes wrong don't worry we won't ever be  Using you   Ever again, And the other lady on the phone needs to get a new job she's obviously not happy"
"My favorite coffee shop.  I used to love super dark roast, bold coffee...(and still do!)...but Ox has opened my eyes to how delicious medium roasts can be.  Their coffee is great, people are even nicer.  Cute vibe inside too!"
"My favorite creole restaurant in NOLA!

the ambience is very cute and inviting. There's outdoor seating or inside seating. While you wait for a table you can either also sit at the bar or outside in the garden with a fountain. 

I ordered:

Gumbo: 5/5 so much flavor and lots of shredded chicken and sausage chunks. 

Grits 5/5: my favorite. They pour the soup right over the grits in front of you. The shrimp had a nice crunch. 

Daily pasta: 5/5 it was a vegetable tomatoe pasta. SO GOOD. The sauce was def homemade or something because it couldn't get enough of it. 

Wild bore sausage: 4/5 had a nice bite when you chewed it. The flavor was good but the portion was very very small of it. 

It's located in the French quarter so don't be scared thinking it's a tourist trap! Some good food here."
"This place is absolutely terrible. My nails looked so good but as soon as I went to wash them when they were done, the top clear coat started to come off. I had to go in two times to get my nails fixed to how they are supposed to look. I was treated poorly and got rushed. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."
"Not my favorite place to eat but sometimes you just want a cold beer and wings, when presto, Hooters was right in front of us. So in we went.

I've eaten at mant Hooters (hubby loves it!) and although this is not my fav (Mesa Arizona is) the girls were nice, service was quick, food so-so and beer was cold.

This is one of those ya know what your getting when you go there kinda places. Wings have gotten quite small I noticed...but otherwise..was what I was expecting!"
"Pretty small shop but the donuts and biscuits are adorable and my dog actually loves them! They have great flavors and a good variety and even treats for animals with special needs like grain free. They have a treat bar for on the go bags, but my dog really likes the refrigerated treats. I can't wait to try their birthday cakes lol. Also the woman who works there is so nice and patient, my dog accidentally got away from me and ran behind the counter O_O I was so embarrassed but she treated him so kindly. We love our trips here!"
"Food was okay, nothing to come back for honestly. The service wasn't great and is the main reason for the low rating. It was slow and not thorough at all. Between taking our order and bringing out our food, it took over half an hour before the first item was delivered to the table. The crab cakes were mostly batter, which was disappointing. Two of our orders were forgotten, and when we asked our server about it, they had no idea what happened to it and we ended up canceling one of them because it would have taken way too long to wait on that. Was super excited to try this place out based on reviews but ended up cutting our losses. :("
"The community staff are very friendly, always ready to help you with anything you need. Pet friendly and nice community all together. The maintenance staff do a great job keeping community clean. First apartment and very satisfied. The new upgrades are nice."
"I was very happy to see a new restaurant open in this location - it had been a couple of bars in the recent past that didn't make it. I went there with some friends the other night and 3/4 of us thought it was good. Not great, just good. BUT...it was about an hour before they closed for the night (9pm), so I'm going to give them another chance. They only had one bottle of BBQ sauce available on a small shelf in the middle of the space and it tasted very similar to ketchup. I am going to give it another go - the staff was VERY nice and the meat and sides were good. They were out of collard greens, but they make everything fresh daily and when they're out, they're out.  I'll try it again in a few days! Maybe we can get more stars going for them!"
"I've been here many times to get my nails and feet done. It's been a while since I've been, but this place popped into my mind today.
 I was a repeat customer for some time, they would give me 2 glasses of wine. Well not really wine wine, but Arbor Mist. 
 The massage I got was great!. The room was nice and dim, smelled fresh, candles, and relaxing music. The decor was pretty. She did a really good deep tissue massage. I just got my upper body done for 30 minutes. 
 I only stopped going because I don't like acrylics anymore, plus I can give myself a regular manicure and pedicure at home."
The food we got from here was absolutely delicious. I am so glad we found this place and I think we will be ordering from here again. The staff was curiously disinterested in me when I came to pick up my food and made a point to tell me that we should order through Facebook next time not through GrubHub.
"Well, not so much luck here. Said our car would be ready at 1:00.  Tried to call at least six times to confirm it was ready for pickup. Never got to someone who could answer that simple question.  So we just went at 2 and, of course it was not ready.  My husband being the loud cranky sort in these situations did manage to get a loaner truck from them for the night. Our car won't even be ready until tomorrow. Bottom line - the lousy customer service in the phone translated to lost service in site as well."
"Very sub par, small plates & dare walk in to the bathrooms. Rice seemed like it was yesterdays."
"Another tasty addition to the stl restaurant scene.  Went here with some friends on a Saturday night.  We requested outdoor seating and were seated in the alley, which was gorgeous and nicely decorated.  

It's been a while since I have been to a restaurant and I was excited to order drinks!  I tried the mango caipirinha  first and it was very refreshing.  For my second drink, I had the dolce de leche tini, which I initially didn't like but got better as it sat.

For dinner I ordered the salmon and my husband got the mahi mahi.  Both were cooked well and came with yummy sides.  Service was quick and the waiter was very friendly.  

Def a good place to check out!"
"Wow! This is a crazy good all you can eat sushi bar. We had to wait awhile...but it was worth it. Service was quick but the presentation was beautiful. We got Micky Mouse, Hiroba, and Sashimi. Too bad it is one state away from us."
Good place to workout during your lunch break.  Simmer will be here soon. Have to go hard now.
"Yeap, only 2 stars!

For appetizer: we ordered calamari. It was not good, too much breading and super greasy. 

Entree: I ordered lamb with roasted potatoes and sugar snaps. For $20, I was really hoping for something extravagant. It was mostly bones and the potatoes were horrible. Way too crispy, I couldn't even split them with a knife. I wish they would present the plate of food better. Looked like everything was thrown in at the last minute. 

Dessert: make your own donut and brownie sundae. Loved the donuts with chocolate and caramel sauces. Great idea. 

Sadly, I won't be back. For the $$, I wish they would put more effort into it."
We arrived to the airport and had time to kill before some of the other family arrived. We got our luggage and came to hangout here until everyone else arrived. Katie was a great bartender and was very persistent on if we needed anything. Drinks we're so good (sunrise sangria) & you can never go wrong with chips and salsa! Thank you Katie for your wonderful service :)
The food and drinks are amazing.  The staff was very busy and didn't miss a beat with serving our 12 person table.  I recommend the Monster Margaritas for the brave and thirsty.
Their falafel sandwich with the harissa sauce was really good. The seating can be tough if you go during busy hours.
"For any guys who are curious,

Yes, this place does cater to men and despite the ambiguous pricing, it's basically the same. 13 bucks for brows. Anjuthreads is definitely on the pricier side, but well worth it. The woman who did mine sat me down and had me out of the chair in less than 5 mins and needed zero prompting or direction. I was very pleased with the results."
"Always unhappy with service there. One time I brought a package in marked fragile. The gal behnd the counter picked it up and TOSSED it in back of her quite far. That should have warned me. 

I went back to rent a mailbox from them and another gal was about as unhelpful, rude and nasty as could be. Extremely unprofessional. 

Other places in D'town and central Bucks that do the same thing. I only went there because it was convenient to a grocery store and K-mart. Now, I just go to another place in D'town."
"Wow! This place is nothing short of awesome. If you're looking for upscale, swanky, quiet, and expensive, go somewhere else. They had live music, quick service, great bar food, and an overall happy crowd. This is the place to be if you want to enjoy food, drinks, and music outdoors. People with boats can dock there as well. It is such a fun crowd of people. I snagged a Corona (only $5 on tap) and the Rick's famous fish sandwich. The sandwich was delicious and even with a large crowd, I was served super quick. The prices for food are very reasonable, just about everything is $10 or less! Where else in Tampa will you find that, especially being out on the water? I'll wait....Exactly, you won't find it! This place is also good for crowds, I will definitely have my wedding party spend some time here for festivities, I want to bring everyone here. Go, eat, drink, and be merry! I recommend this spot!"
"I'm torn about this place. The food is really delicious and well priced. My roommates and I have tried lots of things from this place and its always tasty. My issue is that delivery can take forever. Forever. I've ended up eating another dinner and keeping my Chinese as leftovers because its taken so long. The other side of that  is that going to pick up the food from the restaurant always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's not in a nice building by any means and twice I have been harassed in the waiting area by other...patrons. The food is delicious and the people are nice, but getting the food means picking the lesser of two evils. I would say don't call when you're already really hungry and craving Chinese food and know what you're getting in to if you decide to go pick it up yourself."
"We've passed this place 1,000 times without stopping.  Our neighbors told us we needed to try it. We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Kee Kee and I hope to see her cheerful self each and every time we go back.  My husband had the chicken and I had the avocado toast. Both were delicious!  Kee Kee let us know that the next time we come in we have to get the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter.  We will definitely be back!  We'll be back for the delicious food and we will definitely ask for Kee Kee!"
"I am not much on haunted houses but we came out tonight to hear Adam Pearce sing in the band Mothership. Adam is our friend and he is on this seasons The Voice!  #teamadampearce #thevoice 
Parking is take it if you see it and not too hard to find. Be prepared to walk. You can buy a drink at the bar while waiting in the long line for the House of Shock.  #dontliketobescared
I had no desire to be scared so we watched the free music since our friend was singing. 
Just a few things we  noticed...
Plenty of police officers available for security
No outside beverages are allowed once entering the area of the House of Shock
We were told the regular tickets to get inside of the House of Shock is $30 and the VIP ticket is $55. I guess if you like scary things this is a doable price but for me I can walk in a cemetery at night and get scared for free. #cemeteriesarefree

The reason I gave this a 4 Star is because you have access to free music and can purchase beer and food if you would like. ( beer will cost around $6)"
Best food I have had in 10 years! The steak melted in your mouth and the chicken Florentine is to die for! We don't know the owner but asked her to come out because it was so amazing and she is so proud! It is great to see! It is covid safe and the staff is wonderful!
"We needed a new glass door for our shower in our master bedroom. I reached out thru their website, they had someone to measure the next morning. We agreed on price that day, they ordered the kit and was installed in less than 2 hours a week later.Very professional and easy to deal with.Highly recommend."
"This place deserves 5 stars. It's a crowded place and we were told that wait time was 15 minutes. It took less than that time for us to be seated. Service was great and food was so good. Their grilled octopus was cooked to perfection and it was tender. We ordered their original greek salad, spanakopita, gyro, and saganaki. All food was fresh and tasted great."
"This is one of the newest Walgreens in town.  Really well designed, clean and very modern.  Wide aisles, well stocked etc.  I had to get a prescription filled and they have an interesting set up.  You give them the script and then sit in an area with a TV screen which shows your first name and last name initial to check to see where you stand in getting your prescription filled.  So thinking this was really cool, I just shopped around the store.  Came back to the sitting area and checked once again to see status of my order.  Still stated it was in progress.  Walked around the store again.  Came back 15 minutes later.  Still the same progress on the script.  Boldly checked with the clerk and she went in the back and checked and said it was ready.  Asked her why it wasn't posted on the TV screen, she said she was too busy.  So much for progress.  Oh well, it really has potential for working properly eventually.  Checking the prices on items.  They are pretty high.  But for convenience and cleanliness and being well stocked I'd have to say it is AOK."
"When MT first opened, it was decent. There were multiple servers assigned to a theatre and service was quick. After tonight's experience, stay far away from this place. It's taken a turn for the worst.

Our movie was at 8pm and we were not let into the theatre until 10 minutes before the movie. Once we got in, we put the buttons on to order our drinks/food and we did not see a server until 30 minutes into the movie. There was one server for the entire theatre and he was obviously frazzled. We gave him cash for our order and he didn't give us change. He came around the entire theatre once and never returned, some people had their buttons on the entire movie waiting for service. The food is basic and nothing special. I had a pizza and it was obviously frozen because it was served with cardboard underneath of it. Even the popcorn we had tasted burnt.

This place had some great potential when it opened, but it seems like the new company (Marcus) has really run this place to the ground. It's a great concept, but it seems like they have major staffing problems. Hopefully they can turn it around, but I doubt I'll be back."
"This was my very first time at the AMC Painter's Crossing. I have been to the Movie Tavern in Collegeville, so I already had some pretty lofty expectations going in.  As soon as we walked in, I immediately was not impressed with the lobby area. It was pretty small, and I could see this area getting easily congested on a Friday/Saturday night. Fortunately we went at 5pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn't too bad. 

The theater itself is very nice. The leather seats were comfortable enough that allowed for a pleasurable movie experience. The main thing with me was the overpriced food. The quality of the food is pretty bad (think Applebee's). $16 for a chicken tender plater entree that was mediocre at best is completely ridiculous. The alcoholic beverages were actually more reasonably priced than the Applebee's quality food. We don't mind spending money on good food, but the food served at this AMC left much to be desired. We should have went to the the Carrabba's across the way. I'm sure we would have spent less there on the (moderately better) food than we did at the movie theater.

The moral of this review is that unless you're absolutely starving, stick to just getting popcorn and a beverage (or an adult beverage). Take your appetite elsewhere unless you like overpaying for subpar food. We certainly would come back to this AMC, but the next time we'll stick with the usual popcorn and beverage combination. If you fancy eating decent food, the Movie Tavern has a pretty significant edge on AMC, even though the food prices are pretty similar."
"Great coffee shop with yummy goodies 
Thanks for sponsoring the Monday night knitting group"
My favorite place to eat. I have been coming here since the doors have opened . I can say I have never had bad service and or service.  Came here to celebrate my dad's birthday with a party of over 10. They were impressed with the service and food. My family now knows why I come here so much. The bartender Sam has been amazing.  Very knowledgeable as far as drinks and what is on the menu. If you go by yourself or don't feel like waiting for a table sot at thr bar.
I ordered a two topping pizza with chicken and jalapenos. In return i get only half a pizza of topping. The other half is plain cheese. Thanks papajohns for a lovely friday evening dinner!!. Will think thrice before i order from this store again.
"Best pizza and subs (cold or hot) in the area.  I highly recommend the Philly and any of the pizzas.  Friendly staff, clean, fast service, and great food.  Wish they were closer to my house so they could deliver to me!"
"I like this place a lot. 
From the decor to the food everything was excellent. 
I love that they play 90s music videos on their TVs. The menus are old albums. 

Mystery beer. 

The food is real cheap and real good. Scrapple bites. Kung PO tofu. $5 nachos that could feed a family. 
The place wasn't packed and it wasn't too loud. I like my friends. So when I go out with them I want to be able to hear them talk. That's the measure of a good bar to me. 
Server was excellent. 
Anyway I was really impressed. I'd go back in a heartbeat."
"This is by far the most inviting Vietnamese place in the St Petersburg area. Best food, clean place, family environment!"
"Chilli, cornbread, and collard greens.. deeeeeee-licious!!  The meal price reasonable, food nice and hot, staff was friendly.   First time here, and I will be back!!"
"Excellent service! Went for a mani pedi and was tended to right away. Nails looking fab and ready for sandals! Oh, make am appointment because they do get busy!"
"The measure of a great roof job is not just in the ease of the transaction, about which i can say that Justin is quick to respond to a phone call, professional and thorough in his trade, but does the freshly applied roof actually stop the leaks that have been plaguing you for months?

My roof is just shy of being a full fledged ""crispy critter"", but Justin informed me that we can extend the life for another 8 or so years with his coating.

My roof was re-coated last week.  It took Justin and his worker one full day (spread over two mornings) to complete my roof.  They were on time both days, communicated clearly what they were doing and when.  Then they just did their job, without leaving any kind of a mess behind.

THE TEST:  11/3/2016 - Eastside of Tucson gets a real gully washer of a storm that comes through about 7:30ish at night.  As the thunder rolled and the lightning sizzled through the air, my wife and I started dashing about the house, checking all the spots that leaked prior to the new roof going on...NOTHING WAS LEAKING!  The rain came down in sheets, in several coursed over the next hour or so and not so much as a drop inside.

If I could give you 10 stars I would."
Long way away from airport. Shuttle service isn't very frequent in they morning and early morning staff don't greet you to take your car off your hands.
The ice cream is absolutely delicious. The flavors are very creative. The atmosphere is very chill and relaxed. They've got a minimalist vibe going on in the place. It's definitely cool to watch them make your ice cream rolls. Sweet spot to hang with friends or just grab dessert.
"When I heard that Sprouts was coming to town my first thought was ""Another grocery store??"" But now that I've been there several times I'm really glad they are an option available to us now. They have a wide variety of interesting products and their prices are quite reasonable. Using coupons is something I should do but most the time do not bother with. Their app makes it so easy that even I don't mind it. You can just select the deals you want in the app and when you check out you scan a code from the app and it takes care of everything. They'll also just give away stuff from the app. I got a 16 oz bottle of coconut water for free! Their prepared foods they make are actually my favorite of any grocery store chain. They're not frozen, but rather refrigerated items that you can just throw in the microwave. The stuffed shells are especially good. One complaint that I have is that the bakery section is so boring. After seeing the beautiful cakes, pastries, tarts, etc in the display cases at Publix or Whole Foods it's kind of a let down. I also wish that we could buy smaller portions of desserts because I don't need that temptation around me. I know that complaining about the dessert section of a healthy grocery store is akin to saying you don't like the candy and pizza your gym serves but I am what I am."
"Awesome food! They do not skimp on the meat for their tacos. They serve pico and a blended sauce with their chips, pico is very mild, but the blended sauce...not so much, has a little kick at the end, but has GREAT flavor!"
"LOVE my lashes. Can't say enough about how beautiful they came out. I had the lash profusion treatment with Cecelia. I really appreciate that she took time to explain everything along the way with the process. She also gave me some great insight to their other services, like personalized facials! Very happy customer."
"Do not go to an IHOP on a weekend! Any IHOP!
But do go there on a weekday morning to join the blue hairs for some shit on a shingle! 

No thanks... But I will have the Pancakes with one egg over medium!
Why IHOP's pancakes are so good:

1. The mix is so basic- but consistent. 
2. the SYRUP! I love mixing them all together just for fun!
3. That happy feeling (not unsimilar of eating a small McDonalds cheeseburger twice a year while hungover)
4. speaking of hangovers... very good for that- sops up all the booze!

Ok, I'm tired now..."
"Table was not ready when we got there but it was pretty busy. We had about a 10 minute wait. Cute place, on the smaller side. They had attentive servers. I loved the cannoli! House wine was pretty good too!"
I have to stop myself from eating here as much as I want to! The beer and pizza are awesome. My favorite pizza in Tampa and an awesome selection of beer. Leftovers never last 24 hours in this house! Great people and even beer to go.. love everything about the place.
We just happened upon them while shopping at the outlets in blackwood nj. We got the sampler for 2 with the smoked truffle fries. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOOD. Wish we got a sampler for 4....
"The entire ""feel"" of the place is a bit dated and there's nothing fancy about it but it has friendly, solid service and my room was clean and quiet.  Ate one dinner and a breakfast in their restaurant.  Service there was efficient but not terribly friendly but the food was respectable."
"Hello I had a small errand to run that was nearby early in the morning and noticed Kim's sign that said open and coffee. I had a pleasure meeting the sweetest person even though I was not there to buy cake. Her kindness was heartfelt and genuine. These are the type of people that you want to do business with.  If you need a cake and I got to imagine a pie, muffins, croissants, or any other type of baked good Give Kim a call."
"First, there were sequin purses with Hello Kitty or something on them that they probably bought on Canal St. and marked up 10,000%. Why, I do not know. 

There are about 9 colleges within 5 miles of this location yet they waste their time on 12-year-olds. Anyway, without realizing what this place was, I went to this location to sell some items (everywhere from Burberry to Gap) and the franchise manager woman I encountered here was atrocious.  She was a mid-life crisis Housewife-wannabe mess! She was dressed younger than she could pull off with her visible wrinkles, bad-dye-job hair, and Theresa Guidice make-up.  She went through about $4000 in clothes I had, and passed on everything but like 2 items.  I was really stunned because I saw Target-type crap on the racks closest to me as I waited, and yet she passed on worn-once or new with tags stuff from BCBG, Bebe, Patagonia, Banana Rep, Ann Taylor 100% cashmere, and some couture names from Neimans.

First, as many have mentioned, it is totally tween-city here; so trendy it was laughable. The better fashion mags teach you to keep in style, but not be a trendy clown, yet it appears that this Plato's is preying on local youth whose bourgeois parents don't know how to guide them into upscale taste.  This Plato's was like a store for lame fashion mags who teach awkward teens how to mimic the look they are being paid to sell by trashy mall stores. The people who actually do that are those who don't understand that replicating a magazine outfit is like copying a catalog to furnish your home. 

Anyway, the tanned nightmare woman basically shamed me for not bringing her trendy low-quality crap, and then offered an insulting price on the two items she did want ($4 total).  So I gave her the look she had earned, gathered my things, and left.  I will not be back ever.  I don't buy trendy clothes, and when I have kids that age they will not be buying trendy clothes either.  I also don't patronize shops run by wrinkled barbies who mentally never left high school. Try an attitude improvement and some gratitude when you've just wasted an hour of someone's time. 

Consignments are what supply your business, right? Why be so ridiculously rude and ungrateful? ""Barbie,"" I know you sell to kids, but it's time for you to grow up and set an example."
"i have been going to this place for decades.  i stopped because the service was so bad.
i went tonight, got terrible service and when paying the manager asked me how things were.  so i told him and got an argument.  if a manger asks you for input and it sucks, they should make it better, not bullshit you.......please read on.
1. everyone else got a hot towel but not me. ""we had so many people we ran out, do you want a cold towel?"".........but there is no one here.   ""we were swamped with to go orders""  but they don't use hot towels.
2. the sushi bar alwasys gives you a little something...noodles or a bite of tuna........they actually..........look you in the eye.....as well
3. . no one the whole time at the sushi bar even looked at me and no one smiles. manager says ""they don't speak english so that's why they don't look at you and smile"".  i pointed to every employee in the place.....my waitress who spoke english, the staff, everyone was horrible.  ""the people who do speak english had a hard day""..
...........horrible service........it was so bad i didn't go for 9 years and when i came back the owner asked me why i was gone for so long. i told him something nice....the reason is the terrible service....

any place that asked you how things are and instead of trying to fix it, makes excuses for it, is not a place i could recomend."
I have never received treatment from any doctor that was as great as Dan. I honestly think this man is a disciple of Jesus Christ for how caring he is. HIGHLY recommend this place. I cannot say enough positive comments about this guy.
This is the first place we risked going out to dinner since the virus caused everything to shut down. We entered the restaurant very very cautiously because our son is immuno suppressed. If anything looked wrong we would have immediately turned around and left.  Everything was perfectly as it should be. Tables are distanced. Hand sanitizer abundantly available. Servers wear masks and gloves. Fresh paper is put onto the table between every visit. Servers knew what to do in keeping their distance. Good air circulation. We never felt at risk. Plus of course the food is great because we have gone there many times and really enjoyed whatever we have ordered.  We will continue going there!
Drive all the way here and they're closed. Online says they're open. Phone line says they're open. Incredibly mismanaged business.
"The good
    Verizon Tech support. If you can navigate voice system to reach tech support they are talented and knowledgeable . The picture also is very good

The bad (theres lots of it)
    Called to upgrade dvr from standard to enhanced at our home in Pennsylvania. Took over 13 phone calls to achieve this. 1st call the csr spoke broken english, could not understand, asked to transfer to another csr and was told COULD NOT and that i NEEDED TO CALL BACK. Encouraging that a communication company cannot transfer a call. 

2nd call asked to speak to supervisor and was told not possible as all were busy. Offered to wait but was told not a option. 

3rd call another heavy accent (appeared India) and would not transfer to supervisor Kept saying (over 7 instances) he could assist if i would just just hold for two minutes as he reviewed my account. Ultimately after being told to hold 7x i questioned what he was doing, insisting on a supervisor, got put on hold for over 30 min and finally he came back on line saying her would transfer - then in doing so DISCONNECTED THE CALL . Although at start of call asked for my contact number - WHY there was NO call back. 

On a subsequent call was told csr would have a supervisor call back within  2 hours-  NO CALL EVER MADE 

Finally a csr took the order (changes) and emailed me a copy. Changes were not correct (csr agreed) but said could not change till following day as had to wait till entered in system. Advised would make changes next morning and call me to confirm. NEVER HAPPENED. 

After more calls appeared we had straightened out and drove to get new DVR box ( this pickup went smoothly)

Upon connecting the box (not hard) it would not register. Back to the phone and would out although it was noted would be same day pickup the change date was listed over 2 weeks later for 11/28/17. This again took multiple calls  to identify and resolve. Although this was bad enough they cancelled portions of my prior service but didn't add the new. Just like dealing with the KEYSTONE COPS. 

Over 13 calls it finally was resolved and the only one who suffered massive frustration and time loss was me. Of course nothing from Verizon- not even a free movie.

Verizon touts their customer service however my experience was incompetent and horrific service excluding tech support. Embarrassment for a major company in the communications industry 

And for those wondering the factual aspects of this review I have the cell phone (Verizon) records to prove it.m"
I ordered and paid on line. Seem to work fine. The meal was ready to go when I arrived. When I opened it at home it was horrible. Most of the ingredients were missing. I called and the manager said she would remake it. I went back and watched them make which was good.  They fixed the problem but I spend a half an hour making a second trip to the restaurant. Do not order on line. Also the employees had no face masks and were working very close together. Made me feel very concerned. The customer side was good.
Wish I could give zero stars. Horrible company and horrible owners. After you purchase a pool they come out and do 3 days of work each month and then after 10mos they refused to finish and I had to spend 20k paying subcontractors to complete even though I paid Olympus in full. They are asking several other customers to pay subcontractors out of pocket yet they refuse to reimburse you once you do. Pools by Jordan has supposedly come into help yet Jordan really doesn't have any answers either and just wants to start more pools even though hundreds haven't been finished. Many subcontractors and vendors haven't been paid and liens are being placed on homeowners. Olympus and Jordan have stated that is not a priority. Stay away from these companies because they are terrible with customer service and you will end up with what most are calling a nightmare..
"My girlfriend and I recently did a 1 night stay here. I booked it before through the Recreation app it received really good reviews. We both the campsite was boring, lacked good scenery, bathrooms were dirty and the parking spots are TINY. My Chevy Colorado barely fit in the parking spot. We had spot #11 and the fire pit/BBQ/bench is about 50 feet away on a semi steep rocky hill. The campsite also didn't allow us to use the fire pit or BBQ grill. The site also had a pretty bad fly problem too. I'm glad we only stayed 1 night. Probably won't return any time soon."
"Hands down my favorite STORE in the entire city.  Not just favorite hardware store, but just favorite store.  I love stopping in here when I need anything for around my apartment.  These guys won't only just help you get what you need, but they will tell you how to do whatever it is you are doing if you are unsure.  If you have no idea what you need to do something - just stop in and tell them what you are trying to do and they will hook you up.  Super friendly and resourceful staff.  I love this place!"
"Great food! The carne asada is amazing with the guacamole, rice, and vegetables. The other bits of food that I tried (salsa, enchiladas) were also very good as well. The waiters were kind and understanding."
"This is one of our favorite local establishments, and almost always get a ranchero and an egg & cheese.  They usually have B1G1 coupons in the local mailings."
"*insert obligatory ""this place is the wurst!"" joke*

Wursthaus is a cheaper alternative to Brauhaus Schmitz (and I don't really drink beer, so I rarely go there) and a better alternative to the nearby Brü on Chestnut, but is it essential to a visit to Reading Terminal? No, they're probably not even on the radar of the New Yorkers who come to tell us how much better their food is, like DiNic's and the Amish. 

I come here when I get tired of Dinic's after having it every week for a month, or when I crave some good old German food. 

The specialty sandwiches are HUGE for just $8, like a foot long! You don't even need a side, which I'm dying to try since the sides at Brauhaus are amazing, but the sandwiches are so large, you don't even need them! The Bavarian (smoked sausage, Bavarian coleslaw, fried onions, and horseradish sauce) is a great choice, but I found myself disappointed in the amount of meat on the Leberkäse sandwich (German onion meatloaf, grilled onions, and spicy horseradish mustard). 

P.S. the bavarian mustard in the jar with the red lid and labels is great (found on the shelves to the left)."
I have been dying to try a Peruvian restaurant in the area.  We drove to the location on Belcher then to the address off of why 19.  Both addresses were closed and no one answered the phone when I called.  Is the business permanently closed?  We were so disappointed.
"Meh, pizza crust was blah and not crisp at all for being a thin crust. Wings were pitifully small and the sauce was weak. Ranch was great though and the steak fries were good but you can't really call fries & ranch a meal, so... 3 stars."
"I love Renaud's more than any other place in SB.  Renaud's is my #1 place to go when I return home for a visit.  The accommodations are a little tight, but quaint nevertheless and the patio is nice, if the weather permits.  Absolutely can't go wrong with the quiche or croque madame!  Love it!!!"
"Moon Under Water is a cute restaurant. The location is great and the atmosphere is nice if you sit on the patio. The inside of the restaurant looks like a dark depressing basement and the food is just OK. I got the fish and chips and I swear it had NO seasoning. My boyfriend got the Guinness burger and it was pretty good. If you are in the St. Pete area, looking for a patio, and want a cold beer I would recommend trying Moon, but do not go for the food."
"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Bru Burger Carmel, considering how many times I have ordered it. Too many good things to say about this place. I've been a loyal customer since before their Carmel location, and would venture downtown to the Mass Ave location for their delicious burgers. So happy this closer location opened up. I would previously only order the BBQ Mexicali Burger, because I figured, how can you possibly get better than that. Then, on a whim, I tried the Salmon Sandwich. I never would normally put salmon but this is so so yummy. After realizing their menu was probably stacked equally delicious items, I then tried the taco salad. For it being a burger place, this is now my favorite salad ever. I also can't leave out their fries with the housemade ketchup. To round it all out, the white chocolate peach bread pudding is definitely a top 3 restaurant dessert. Also, their carry out process is very easy. In summation, CANNOT GO WRONG."
"Ok place.   Amazing food and drink

Yummy Bugsy Burger.  Great chicken wings

Strong drinks

2 pools tables and 3 dart boards

Great staff"
"We went here after realizing House of India was too far to walk. The buffet was small but looked promising.   Ambiance... maybe a 5/10. Service was great, the host was very friendly and explained all the food to us. The issue was that it wasn't very good. It was over spiced, to compensate for I don't know what. The palak paneer was so salty, the chicken tikka masala so overly tomatoey, the chana daal bland. It was okay, and not terribly overpriced, but I am usually quite happy with Indian food and the only thing I liked was some meatballs."
