# Item description:
The aim of the lecture is to discuss the principles of constructing relational databases and to provide students with the skills of professionally operating a database system from the user's perspective, i.e.:

* skills in designing and creating relational databases for real-world issues;
* efficient searching and retrieval of information from databases using SQL languages.
* writing applications with access to databases;
* effective use of additional system capabilities (perspectives, transactions, constraints, etc.).

In addition, the lecture allows the audience to learn about the elements of database systems beyond the user layer (transaction supervision, security and optimization systems) and to become familiar with other database concepts that go beyond the relational standard (e.g. graph databases, elements of distributed databases).

## Lecture program:

1. Basic database concepts and conceptual modeling.
2. Relational databases. Data description languages ​​and query languages. SQL.
3. Active database elements (integrity constraints, triggers).
4. Elements of database systems (transactions, data security and authorization, combining relational query languages ​​with native languages).
5. Relational database theory (functional dependencies, normalization and denormalization).
6. Methods of writing applications with access to databases.
7. Other database models ( including graph databases, big data processing).

## Exercise and workshop program:

1. Conversational classes that facilitate practical mastery of relational database design.
2. Mastering queries in SQL languages.
3. Laboratory classes allowing familiarization with database management systems (PostgreSQL, etc.).
4. Creation of a complete design of a small database.
