# Item description:

The course program will cover creating games in the Unity3D engine.

It will start with several lectures on the basics of the Unity engine and a general introduction to the gaming industry.
The topics of the next lectures will include:

* creating c# scripts and connecting them to the main engine (GameObject, Component, MonoBehaviour, editable public variables), prefabs, instantiation, Update/FixedUpdate/Start, searching for objects from code
* modeling, texturing, asset import
* physics (soft, rigid body), particle systems
* animations, state machine, menu animation, people animation
* lighting, lightmap bagging, daylight, artificial light
* shaders
* testing (including automated tests), TDD (test driven development)
* materials (including Physically Based Shading materials)
* types of rendering (forward, deferred)
* post process effects (e.g. bloom, color grading)
* effects: screen space ambient occlusion and screen space reflections
* standard assets

The course is from scratch, which means that it does not require prior knowledge of C# or a 3D modeling program.

The lecture will be held in a 2-hour cycle: the first hour will discuss another fragment of the Unity engine, and the second hour will use the knowledge gained in practice to create a game.

The assessment consists of points for solving task lists (each list is a game or a fragment of it to be completed), and a presentation of the final project (a game designed and written by the student).

Examples of projects that may appear in the workshop:

* Arkanoid
* Asteroids
* Tetris
* Snake
* Your own final mini game project

Depending on their complexity, the task lists will take from one to four weeks to complete (on most lists, you will be able to choose one of two games to complete).
