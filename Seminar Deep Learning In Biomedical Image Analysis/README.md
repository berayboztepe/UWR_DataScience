# Item description:

Deep learning is rapidly revolutionizing biomedical image analysis. Yet, unlike fields where deep learning is applied to intuitively understandable data domains like photographs, biomedical images are often acquired under domain-specific assumptions using complex equipment to solve tasks with high equivocation. Specialized deep learning algorithms take these priors into account making such scientific papers hard to understand for a computer scientist lacking the necessary background. In this seminar series, we will explore the most recent scientific literature involving deep learning algorithms used in biomedical image analysis. In a group effort, we will understand the priors and assumptions of biomedical image acquisition and analysis and understand the cutting-edge approaches.

Contribution: regular paper reading by all, rotating presentation by individuals or small groups of students.
