# Item description:

The course is aimed at students that would like to survey the basics of the services offered by the three main cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Students are supposed to self-study the topics using the free teaching materials provided by Google, AWS or some other available tutorials.

I have used Google Cloud Platform.
