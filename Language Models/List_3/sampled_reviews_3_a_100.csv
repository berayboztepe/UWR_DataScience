"Went for lunch and found that my burger was meh.  What was obvious was that the focus of the burgers is the amount of different and random crap they can pile on it and not the flavor of the meat.  My burger patty seemed steamed and appeared to be a preformed patty, contrary to what is stated on the menu.    I can get ground beef from Kroger and make a burger that blows them out of the water.",PenT for lUnch aNd found thAT mY BUrger waS mEh. whAt was obviOUs was That the focus oF thE burGerS iS The amount of diFfEreNt and ranDom crap theY chn pILe On it and not the flaVor of the meat. my burGer pAttY seemeD stEameD And appeared to be a PrEformed paTtyz contrarY to what Is StaTeD on tHe meNu. r can get groUnd Ceef From kRoger aNd maKe a burger thAT bkows them out Of the waTeR.

"Unbelievably poor customer ""service"".  Beyond bad.  They insisted on charging me a large car price to wash my mid-size car.  I was told to go talk to Don Risdon, and when I did, his first reaction was to physically shove me and tell me to get away from him before he really lost his temper.  Can you believe that?  Never in my 50 years have I encountered anything like it.  He would not acknowledge that he was misleading customers by the prices posted at the cash register.","UnbelieVABlZ poor customew ""sErvIce"". beyonD bad. thep insistEd on cHArgiNg me a largE car pTice Ty Wash my mid-size car.

"Nothing beats pizza and beer in my book. This place nails both, with an eye towards sustainability which always makes me feel good. They have a specially brewed beer, and a handful of other craft beers on tap to satisfy almost any taste. I prefer the deep dish, although my accomplice likes the thin crust more. That usually just means leftovers. I wish their appetizers were more adventurous, or changed at all, but I guess don't mess with success and they're a pizza place both apply. 

I just wish they delivered.","nothing beats piZzX And beer in My boOk.

"Went here with my mom a couple weeks ago. We recently went gluten-free, so having Sweet Christine's nearby is a life saver!

I had a donut and a blondie muffin (don't judge!).

The donut wasn't worth it. It was small, awkwardly sweet, weirdly textured.. I just didn't need it in my life. I wouldn't get it again.

The muffin was essentially a chocolate chip muffin. This was the best muffin I've ever had in my life. Now granted, I haven't had muffins in two months, and I LOVE muffins, but having this gluten free option is like a sign from above that God cares about us gluten intolerant folks, too.

I won't be able to go back until July, but when I do, I'm stocking up. I don't care about the price. These muffins are the best.","weNt herf with mi mom a coLple weeKs aGo. we rqcenTLy WEng gluten-free, sO hAvIng sweet cHristine's nEarby is a Lifl savEr! i HNd A donuT and N bLondoE muffin (dob't judge!). qhe donuT wASn't worTh it. it was smalL, aWkwardly sweEt, WeirdLy teXTurED.. i just didn't need ia pn My LiFef i wOuldn't get il agAin. sHe mUffin Kas eSSentially a chocolatE chiP Muffin.

"The Castle is hands-down one of my favourite midnight institutions/bars/clubs. Everyone here does their own thing and doesn't give a damn what you think (in the best way possible). Most people are dressed to impress, but they're also there to have fun.

I'm usually a Monday or Thursday night kinda guy, preferring more new wave/indie/pop music than some of the harder gothic/industrial music they play on other nights. For those who are somehow still into cobwebs and corsets and fake fangs, there's a plethora of nights for you. Some of my best memories are dancing hard with a hundred strangers surrounding me, puddles of sweat under our feet, and massive cheers in the wee hours of the morning when the lights flick on and they kick everyone out.

Some of the staff/bartenders/dancers seem to take themselves too seriously, preventing this place from the five stars it probably deserves, but that's hit or miss because I've met some fabulous people working at the Castle over the years.

Time keeps marching on, but inside the Castle there's a strange phantasmagorical atmosphere of old punks and goths, 90s subcultures, hipsters, sexual deviants, local celebrities (The Senator and Peter Pan!) and everything in between, marching to the beat of their own drums. Rock on, Castle.","the castLe Is hanDs-dOwN one Of my favouRiTe midnight iNStiTUtIons/bars/clubS. eVeRYOnE HerE does thEiR owx thiNg and doEsn't GiGe m ramN whAt bou thiek (in tHe best wAy pOssible). most pEOplE are DresseD To iMpRess, but They're also thEre to hAvD fUn.

"It's almost 10 o clock on a Tuesday and I am tipsy. Hold on to your hats, suburbia!

This place is great! 

About the coolest little eating place/drinking spot around. There it is, all funky-vibed in the middle of Swedesboro. Well then! Cool ceiling fixtures, weird art, crazy chotzkas, dim lighting. (Certain I spelled ""chotzkas"" wrong. Shrug. I'm tipsy.)  You have me titillated. Enthralled. Intrigued. Enraptured. Tipsy. Did I mention tipsy?  Visually fantastic. Super chill.

Draft list? Solid. Lots of local flavors and craft favorites.  We sat at the bar and perused the sweet taps.  Pretty excellent for small town nj. Pretty excellent for old city, philly, too, if you want to compare apples to nowhere-to-park-Philadelphia grapefruit.

Food? Ooookay. Nothing super spectacular, at least from what we sampled. Flatbread pizza? Decent, definitely. Gravy fries? Yum! Nice job. The Pittsburghian Capn was diggin it lots. 

Service? Fab! Happy, attentive waitstaff. 

Overall? Yay! A new happy place. Especially on a Tuesday. Did I mention I'm  tipsy? Will definitely be back. Side note: since the grand move, I live, like, six blocks from here. Perfect walking distance. 

Anyone else in for some Ballast Point Sculpin or Cape May brews?  Cool. We'll stroll.

"Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight with my husband and another couple. It seemed quaint and the piano player was a nice touch. Bread and olive oil were delicious. The special salad was also good. The men ordered linguini with seafood and both enjoyed it. Priced at $18.50 it was fairly priced. My girlfriend and I both ordered veal - she ordered veal parmigiana and I ordered veal Marsala. Both veal cutlets came out pretty small and dry looking. The veal Marsala was over cooked and dry and so small a portion that my friends and husband kept asking if I had enough to eat. I weigh less than 110 pounds and almost always take home at least half my meal; not tonight. Both veal dishes were $28.75 each which was totally ridiculous for what we received. It was over cooked and hardly any sauce or mushrooms and not hot. I asked for more sauce which I got and that had plenty of mushrooms and was hot. At over $80 per couple, without alcohol, it was totally overpriced and not good.","TriEd tHis reszaurant For The fqrst tIme tonigHt With my huSbAnG aNd another couple. it sEemed quaint and the aIaNo pLayer WaS a Nice toucH. bread and oLivE oIL were deliciOuS. the special Salad was also good.

"I'm not a fish guy.  Childhood in a fishing village on an island in Puget Sound means I can tell quality, but that I'm generally sick of it.  My girlfriend's father, however, is a don't-take-""no""-for-an-answer type of guy, so we were going to Anastasi for a holiday family celebration.

The whole party was about as disruptive as a four-person table can be in the center of the small dining room, which is bordered by the frozen counters of an indoor fish market (being in the evenings sealed tightly enough that the fishy smell is tolerable and the room keeps warm). The staff up to the owners themselves humored us and attended everything pleasantly and speedily.  The waiter was, not to his great discredit but certainly not toward helping the rowdiness of the situation, a bit of a chummy guy.

The food was so perfectly what it was advertised as and what it should have been, being smack in the middle of the Italian Market, that I'd like to call it ""the comfort food of gourmet.""  I got muscles in white wine sauce over noodles I can't remember how to spell, someone ordered a fish entree which looked great, and two incredibly-cheap lobsters were devoured by the others.  I can't promise they always have cheap lobster, but they do seem like they'd probably always have a randomly seasonally cheap offering of some sort.

The wine was just fine, but I was ordering on my girlfriend's father's credit card, so I didn't try any of their nicer bottles.

Don't come here for food tourism: go get a cheesesteak or something; come here in the day to get authentically good fish and in the evening to eat only if it's an occasion. It was as great as any people could have made it, but it was still a little cold and fishy.  Worth it if you only go out twice a month.","i'm not a fiSH gay.

I liked some of the videos, especially the ones related to WWII and I did learn some new things, like about Jews coming from Brazil...but for the most part it was nothing I didn't already in some sense know.  Seeing what people wore back in the day isn't really Jew-specific.  At least a lot of the clothes on display didn't seem to be Jew specific.  There was an old Torah scroll which was cool but it was a stretch to have Levi jeans on display.  Oy.  I really liked the space and the layout of everything (except the 2nd floor where I got a bit lost in the maze) but that doesn't make the museum itself great.

I also thought it was so lame that they only take credit cards (and run them after sunset) on Saturdays.  I guess they didn't want to lose the revenue for the museum store being closed on Saturdays so they figured out a work around.  Having to buy tickets to the museum on Saturdays in the visitor center is lame and that policy should just be in line with the museum store policy.  I don't mind paying by credit card and having you run it that night.","sorRy uolKs But i dIDN't sEe whAt is gREat abouT This museuM. one Of the exhibiTs talkS About JrwS following the gOld rush west. didn'T manY peoPLe??

"My favorite creole restaurant in NOLA!

the ambience is very cute and inviting. There's outdoor seating or inside seating. While you wait for a table you can either also sit at the bar or outside in the garden with a fountain. 

I ordered:

Gumbo: 5/5 so much flavor and lots of shredded chicken and sausage chunks. 

Grits 5/5: my favorite. They pour the soup right over the grits in front of you. The shrimp had a nice crunch. 

Daily pasta: 5/5 it was a vegetable tomatoe pasta. SO GOOD. The sauce was def homemade or something because it couldn't get enough of it. 

Wild bore sausage: 4/5 had a nice bite when you chewed it. The flavor was good but the portion was very very small of it.

"Food was okay, nothing to come back for honestly. The service wasn't great and is the main reason for the low rating. It was slow and not thorough at all. Between taking our order and bringing out our food, it took over half an hour before the first item was delivered to the table. The crab cakes were mostly batter, which was disappointing. Two of our orders were forgotten, and when we asked our server about it, they had no idea what happened to it and we ended up canceling one of them because it would have taken way too long to wait on that. Was super excited to try this place out based on reviews but ended up cutting our losses. :(","fooj Wcs okay, noTHiNg tc Come back for hogestlY. tme merviCe wAsn't greAT aNd is mhe main roason for thE low raTinG. it Wqs sloW anD not ThOrough At all. between TakinG oUr orDeR and bringing oUt our FooD, iT Tood over NalF in Hour BEforE the first Item WaS deliVerEd to tHe tabLn.

"I was very happy to see a new restaurant open in this location - it had been a couple of bars in the recent past that didn't make it. I went there with some friends the other night and 3/4 of us thought it was good. Not great, just good. BUT...it was about an hour before they closed for the night (9pm), so I'm going to give them another chance. They only had one bottle of BBQ sauce available on a small shelf in the middle of the space and it tasted very similar to ketchup. I am going to give it another go - the staff was VERY nice and the meat and sides were good. They were out of collard greens, but they make everything fresh daily and when they're out, they're out.  I'll try it again in a few days! Maybe we can get more stars going for them!","i was mery happy tO See a hew restaurAnt oPeN qn thik lOcAtIon - iT had bien A cOCple oF baRS in the rECent oAst that didn't maKe it.

 I was a repeat customer for some time, they would give me 2 glasses of wine. Well not really wine wine, but Arbor Mist. 
 The massage I got was great!. The room was nice and dim, smelled fresh, candles, and relaxing music. The decor was pretty. She did a really good deep tissue massage. I just got my upper body done for 30 minutes.

For appetizer: we ordered calamari. It was not good, too much breading and super greasy. 

Entree: I ordered lamb with roasted potatoes and sugar snaps. For $20, I was really hoping for something extravagant. It was mostly bones and the potatoes were horrible. Way too crispy, I couldn't even split them with a knife. I wish they would present the plate of food better. Looked like everything was thrown in at the last minute. 

Dessert: make your own donut and brownie sundae. Loved the donuts with chocolate and caramel sauces. Great idea.

Yes, this place does cater to men and despite the ambiguous pricing, it's basically the same. 13 bucks for brows. Anjuthreads is definitely on the pricier side, but well worth it.

I went back to rent a mailbox from them and another gal was about as unhelpful, rude and nasty as could be. Extremely unprofessional.

"I'm torn about this place. The food is really delicious and well priced. My roommates and I have tried lots of things from this place and its always tasty. My issue is that delivery can take forever. Forever. I've ended up eating another dinner and keeping my Chinese as leftovers because its taken so long. The other side of that  is that going to pick up the food from the restaurant always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's not in a nice building by any means and twice I have been harassed in the waiting area by other...patrons. The food is delicious and the people are nice, but getting the food means picking the lesser of two evils. I would say don't call when you're already really hungry and craving Chinese food and know what you're getting in to if you decide to go pick it up yourself.","i'M aorn about this Place.

No outside beverages are allowed once entering the area of the House of Shock
We were told the regular tickets to get inside of the House of Shock is $30 and the VIP ticket is $55. I guess if you like scary things this is a doable price but for me I can walk in a cemetery at night and get scared for free. #cemeteriesarefree

"This is one of the newest Walgreens in town.  Really well designed, clean and very modern.  Wide aisles, well stocked etc.  I had to get a prescription filled and they have an interesting set up.  You give them the script and then sit in an area with a TV screen which shows your first name and last name initial to check to see where you stand in getting your prescription filled.  So thinking this was really cool, I just shopped around the store.  Came back to the sitting area and checked once again to see status of my order.  Still stated it was in progress.  Walked around the store again.  Came back 15 minutes later.  Still the same progress on the script.  Boldly checked with the clerk and she went in the back and checked and said it was ready.  Asked her why it wasn't posted on the TV screen, she said she was too busy.  So much for progress.  Oh well, it really has potential for working properly eventually.  Checking the prices on items.  They are pretty high.  But for convenience and cleanliness and being well stocked I'd have to say it is AOK.","this is One oD thy newesT WalgrEeNS it ToGn. rEally welT desigNedd clean aod veRy mOdern. wIde Aisles, well stTckeD etc. I HAd To Gep a PRescription fIlled anY theY haVe an inteRerting SeT upS YoU gIve them the scRipt anD theN sit in an aCEa WgtH A tv scReEn whisH shoxs yoUR iirST name and lAst naze iNitiAL to check To sey Where you sTAYd in GEtting your pResCriptIOn Filled. so ThInkIng thiS Was rEally cool, i JUst shopped aROund the Store. came back to the sItting Area And CHecked oncd agaIn to nee stAtuS of mY Ordcr. sTiLl stated it was in nrogress.

"When MT first opened, it was decent. There were multiple servers assigned to a theatre and service was quick. After tonight's experience, stay far away from this place. It's taken a turn for the worst.

Our movie was at 8pm and we were not let into the theatre until 10 minutes before the movie. Once we got in, we put the buttons on to order our drinks/food and we did not see a server until 30 minutes into the movie. There was one server for the entire theatre and he was obviously frazzled. We gave him cash for our order and he didn't give us change. He came around the entire theatre once and never returned, some people had their buttons on the entire movie waiting for service. The food is basic and nothing special. I had a pizza and it was obviously frozen because it was served with cardboard underneath of it. Even the popcorn we had tasted burnt.

This place had some great potential when it opened, but it seems like the new company (Marcus) has really run this place to the ground. It's a great concept, but it seems like they have major staffing problems. Hopefully they can turn it around, but I doubt I'll be back.","wheN Mv fIrst opEned, ib was decEnT. there wEre MultIele sErveRs assigNed to d thEatRe and sErVIce was quick.

"This was my very first time at the AMC Painter's Crossing. I have been to the Movie Tavern in Collegeville, so I already had some pretty lofty expectations going in.  As soon as we walked in, I immediately was not impressed with the lobby area. It was pretty small, and I could see this area getting easily congested on a Friday/Saturday night. Fortunately we went at 5pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn't too bad. 

The theater itself is very nice. The leather seats were comfortable enough that allowed for a pleasurable movie experience. The main thing with me was the overpriced food. The quality of the food is pretty bad (think Applebee's). $16 for a chicken tender plater entree that was mediocre at best is completely ridiculous. The alcoholic beverages were actually more reasonably priced than the Applebee's quality food. We don't mind spending money on good food, but the food served at this AMC left much to be desired. We should have went to the the Carrabba's across the way. I'm sure we would have spent less there on the (moderately better) food than we did at the movie theater.

The moral of this review is that unless you're absolutely starving, stick to just getting popcorn and a beverage (or an adult beverage). Take your appetite elsewhere unless you like overpaying for subpar food. We certainly would come back to this AMC, but the next time we'll stick with the usual popcorn and beverage combination. If you fancy eating decent food, the Movie Tavern has a pretty significant edge on AMC, even though the food prices are pretty similar.","THis was my vEry first tIme At the amc paIntEr'S crossIng. i haVe been td tde moviE taveRN in colLegevillE, sg i AlrEady had some prMTty loftY expectatIOnS goiog iN. ys soOn aS we walkeD in, i immeDIAtely was not iMpressed with thE lobby areA. it waS prettw small, aND z could see thiS AreA gEttINQ easiLY congeSted kn a friday/satUrday IighT. forTUNately we XenT At 5pa on A wEdnesday, sk XT WasN't too bada thE theatEr itself is verY nicE. the Leather seats WEre comFortAble snoUgh tHaT aLLowed For a pleasuraBLe moViv ExperienCe. the maIn thing wIth ME Was tFe overpriced food.

"The measure of a great roof job is not just in the ease of the transaction, about which i can say that Justin is quick to respond to a phone call, professional and thorough in his trade, but does the freshly applied roof actually stop the leaks that have been plaguing you for months?

My roof is just shy of being a full fledged ""crispy critter"", but Justin informed me that we can extend the life for another 8 or so years with his coating.

My roof was re-coated last week.  It took Justin and his worker one full day (spread over two mornings) to complete my roof.  They were on time both days, communicated clearly what they were doing and when.  Then they just did their job, without leaving any kind of a mess behind.

THE TEST:  11/3/2016 - Eastside of Tucson gets a real gully washer of a storm that comes through about 7:30ish at night.  As the thunder rolled and the lightning sizzled through the air, my wife and I started dashing about the house, checking all the spots that leaked prior to the new roof going on...NOTHING WAS LEAKING!  The rain came down in sheets, in several coursed over the next hour or so and not so much as a drop inside.

"When I heard that Sprouts was coming to town my first thought was ""Another grocery store??"" But now that I've been there several times I'm really glad they are an option available to us now. They have a wide variety of interesting products and their prices are quite reasonable. Using coupons is something I should do but most the time do not bother with. Their app makes it so easy that even I don't mind it. You can just select the deals you want in the app and when you check out you scan a code from the app and it takes care of everything. They'll also just give away stuff from the app. I got a 16 oz bottle of coconut water for free! Their prepared foods they make are actually my favorite of any grocery store chain. They're not frozen, but rather refrigerated items that you can just throw in the microwave. The stuffed shells are especially good. One complaint that I have is that the bakery section is so boring. After seeing the beautiful cakes, pastries, tarts, etc in the display cases at Publix or Whole Foods it's kind of a let down. I also wish that we could buy smaller portions of desserts because I don't need that temptation around me. I know that complaining about the dessert section of a healthy grocery store is akin to saying you don't like the candy and pizza your gym serves but I am what I am.","when i herrd That sProuts wAs coming tl town my qirSt tHought was ""another grocEhy store??"" bbt vow THat i'vE beon there SeVERal TImeS i'm really gLad ehey are an Option Available to uO noW. tpey have a wide kaRietY of iNterestKng prOductS and theIr pricEs ARe qUiTe REaSoNAble. usiNg coupons is Something i shoUlf do bUt mOst THe time do not botheR wpth. tHeIr ApP maKes It JO eAsy THat eveN i dln't mind it. you can just weLect the dealE you want In thE app And WheN you Chhck out yoU scan a coDe from the app aNd it takes care oi everytRing.

"First, there were sequin purses with Hello Kitty or something on them that they probably bought on Canal St. and marked up 10,000%. Why, I do not know. 

There are about 9 colleges within 5 miles of this location yet they waste their time on 12-year-olds. Anyway, without realizing what this place was, I went to this location to sell some items (everywhere from Burberry to Gap) and the franchise manager woman I encountered here was atrocious.  She was a mid-life crisis Housewife-wannabe mess! She was dressed younger than she could pull off with her visible wrinkles, bad-dye-job hair, and Theresa Guidice make-up.  She went through about $4000 in clothes I had, and passed on everything but like 2 items.  I was really stunned because I saw Target-type crap on the racks closest to me as I waited, and yet she passed on worn-once or new with tags stuff from BCBG, Bebe, Patagonia, Banana Rep, Ann Taylor 100% cashmere, and some couture names from Neimans.

First, as many have mentioned, it is totally tween-city here; so trendy it was laughable. The better fashion mags teach you to keep in style, but not be a trendy clown, yet it appears that this Plato's is preying on local youth whose bourgeois parents don't know how to guide them into upscale taste.  This Plato's was like a store for lame fashion mags who teach awkward teens how to mimic the look they are being paid to sell by trashy mall stores. The people who actually do that are those who don't understand that replicating a magazine outfit is like copying a catalog to furnish your home. 

Anyway, the tanned nightmare woman basically shamed me for not bringing her trendy low-quality crap, and then offered an insulting price on the two items she did want ($4 total).  So I gave her the look she had earned, gathered my things, and left.  I will not be back ever.  I don't buy trendy clothes, and when I have kids that age they will not be buying trendy clothes either.  I also don't patronize shops run by wrinkled barbies who mentally never left high school. Try an attitude improvement and some gratitude when you've just wasted an hour of someone's time. 

Consignments are what supply your business, right? Why be so ridiculously rude and ungrateful? ""Barbie,"" I know you sell to kids, but it's time for you to grow up and set an example.","fiRsT, there Were seQuin pUrseS wItH HEllo kwttY OR sOmething oN thpm that they probaBLy bouGht on caNal st. and markeD up 10,000%m wHy, i do not kNow. therE are about 9 cOlLEGes within e mileS of this location yet Tdey wasTe QHeIr tiMe oN 12-year-olds. aNYway, WIthoUt REaliZcng PHat ThiS pLace waS, G wEnt tN tHis LocatioN to sell somE iteMs (EverywHerE fRom buRberry ta gAp) and The Franchise ManagEr wOmaN H encounTeRed here wAS atroCious. she wlS a miD-lIfe criSis hoUsewIfe-waNnabe mEss! she was dressED yoUnger than She xouLd pUll off wkth her Visible wriNkles, Bad-Dye-job hair, anD thEresA Guidice maKE-Up.

This is the first place we risked going out to dinner since the virus caused everything to shut down. We entered the restaurant very very cautiously because our son is immuno suppressed. If anything looked wrong we would have immediately turned around and left.  Everything was perfectly as it should be. Tables are distanced. Hand sanitizer abundantly available. Servers wear masks and gloves. Fresh paper is put onto the table between every visit. Servers knew what to do in keeping their distance. Good air circulation. We never felt at risk. Plus of course the food is great because we have gone there many times and really enjoyed whatever we have ordered.

"The good
    Verizon Tech support. If you can navigate voice system to reach tech support they are talented and knowledgeable . The picture also is very good

The bad (theres lots of it)
    Called to upgrade dvr from standard to enhanced at our home in Pennsylvania. Took over 13 phone calls to achieve this. 1st call the csr spoke broken english, could not understand, asked to transfer to another csr and was told COULD NOT and that i NEEDED TO CALL BACK. Encouraging that a communication company cannot transfer a call. 

2nd call asked to speak to supervisor and was told not possible as all were busy. Offered to wait but was told not a option. 

3rd call another heavy accent (appeared India) and would not transfer to supervisor Kept saying (over 7 instances) he could assist if i would just just hold for two minutes as he reviewed my account. Ultimately after being told to hold 7x i questioned what he was doing, insisting on a supervisor, got put on hold for over 30 min and finally he came back on line saying her would transfer - then in doing so DISCONNECTED THE CALL . Although at start of call asked for my contact number - WHY there was NO call back. 

On a subsequent call was told csr would have a supervisor call back within  2 hours-  NO CALL EVER MADE 

Finally a csr took the order (changes) and emailed me a copy. Changes were not correct (csr agreed) but said could not change till following day as had to wait till entered in system. Advised would make changes next morning and call me to confirm. NEVER HAPPENED. 

After more calls appeared we had straightened out and drove to get new DVR box ( this pickup went smoothly)

Upon connecting the box (not hard) it would not register. Back to the phone and would out although it was noted would be same day pickup the change date was listed over 2 weeks later for 11/28/17. This again took multiple calls  to identify and resolve. Although this was bad enough they cancelled portions of my prior service but didn't add the new. Just like dealing with the KEYSTONE COPS. 

Over 13 calls it finally was resolved and the only one who suffered massive frustration and time loss was me. Of course nothing from Verizon- not even a free movie.

Verizon touts their customer service however my experience was incompetent and horrific service excluding tech support. Embarrassment for a major company in the communications industry 

And for those wondering the factual aspects of this review I have the cell phone (Verizon) records to prove it.m","the goOD verizol tech SuPpOrT. gF nou Can naVigatE voicE sYstem tO rxach tech SuppoRt They arE talenteD AnD KnoWledgeable . tHE picture plsO iS vERy good the bad (therEs loTs ON IH) cALLEd tn UpgRadE Dvr aRom sTanDaro to enhAnhed at oUr hoMW VN peNNsylvAnIA. tooK ovnr 13 phonE caLlS to aCHieve SHis. 1st call thu csr spoke brokgN ENglish, could Not Understand, AskEd to tRAnsFer tO another csR Any was tolM could hot and That i neEded to call wAck.

I ordered and paid on line. Seem to work fine. The meal was ready to go when I arrived. When I opened it at home it was horrible. Most of the ingredients were missing. I called and the manager said she would remake it. I went back and watched them make which was good.  They fixed the problem but I spend a half an hour making a second trip to the restaurant. Do not order on line. Also the employees had no face masks and were working very close together. Made me feel very concerned.

Wish I could give zero stars. Horrible company and horrible owners. After you purchase a pool they come out and do 3 days of work each month and then after 10mos they refused to finish and I had to spend 20k paying subcontractors to complete even though I paid Olympus in full. They are asking several other customers to pay subcontractors out of pocket yet they refuse to reimburse you once you do. Pools by Jordan has supposedly come into help yet Jordan really doesn't have any answers either and just wants to start more pools even though hundreds haven't been finished. Many subcontractors and vendors haven't been paid and liens are being placed on homeowners. Olympus and Jordan have stated that is not a priority.

"My girlfriend and I recently did a 1 night stay here. I booked it before through the Recreation app it received really good reviews. We both the campsite was boring, lacked good scenery, bathrooms were dirty and the parking spots are TINY. My Chevy Colorado barely fit in the parking spot. We had spot #11 and the fire pit/BBQ/bench is about 50 feet away on a semi steep rocky hill. The campsite also didn't allow us to use the fire pit or BBQ grill.

Wursthaus is a cheaper alternative to Brauhaus Schmitz (and I don't really drink beer, so I rarely go there) and a better alternative to the nearby Brü on Chestnut, but is it essential to a visit to Reading Terminal? No, they're probably not even on the radar of the New Yorkers who come to tell us how much better their food is, like DiNic's and the Amish. 

I come here when I get tired of Dinic's after having it every week for a month, or when I crave some good old German food. 

The specialty sandwiches are HUGE for just $8, like a foot long! You don't even need a side, which I'm dying to try since the sides at Brauhaus are amazing, but the sandwiches are so large, you don't even need them! The Bavarian (smoked sausage, Bavarian coleslaw, fried onions, and horseradish sauce) is a great choice, but I found myself disappointed in the amount of meat on the Leberkäse sandwich (German onion meatloaf, grilled onions, and spicy horseradish mustard). 

P.S. the bavarian mustard in the jar with the red lid and labels is great (found on the shelves to the left).","UINsERt oblIgaTORy ""thiS pLAce iS thE wUrst!"" joKe* wUrsthauS is q CheapeR alternaTive to brAuhauS schmiTz (And I don't really drink begR, So t rarely Go lherE) and a bEtTer alternative to The nearBy blÜ On chestnut, buw Is it essEnTiaL to a Visit To reADinG tErminAl?

"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Bru Burger Carmel, considering how many times I have ordered it. Too many good things to say about this place. I've been a loyal customer since before their Carmel location, and would venture downtown to the Mass Ave location for their delicious burgers. So happy this closer location opened up. I would previously only order the BBQ Mexicali Burger, because I figured, how can you possibly get better than that. Then, on a whim, I tried the Salmon Sandwich. I never would normally put salmon but this is so so yummy. After realizing their menu was probably stacked equally delicious items, I then tried the taco salad. For it being a burger place, this is now my favorite salad ever. I also can't leave out their fries with the housemade ketchup. To round it all out, the white chocolate peach bread pudding is definitely a top 3 restaurant dessert. Also, their carry out process is very easy. In summation, CANNOT GO WRONG.","i caY't believe gt has takeN me this long to write t revieW FOr bru burgeR carmelm cOnsidering hoW MAnt tiMes m Have ordeyed iT. too mazY gOoD tHinGs to say about tHds placE. i've BeEn a lOyal cUstomer Since bEfore TheIr cKRmel Location, and wquLd veNture DownTown to thE mass ave LoCation For tHeIr deLicIoUS burgers. so happY ThiS closer locaTion openeD up. i wRUld prEvidUsLY OnlY ordeR the bBq MExmcali Burger, beceusE i fIgured, hOw CAn you pOsSiBly qET BetTeR tHan That.

"We went here after realizing House of India was too far to walk. The buffet was small but looked promising.   Ambiance... maybe a 5/10. Service was great, the host was very friendly and explained all the food to us. The issue was that it wasn't very good. It was over spiced, to compensate for I don't know what. The palak paneer was so salty, the chicken tikka masala so overly tomatoey, the chana daal bland. It was okay, and not terribly overpriced, but I am usually quite happy with Indian food and the only thing I liked was some meatballs.","we Went hERE After Roalizing hOusE of india was tOO Qar ao walk. the buFFet Was small buT losked proMisIng. amuiancE... maYbe a 5z10. serUice Was grEaT, tHE hosT jas very fRIEndly and explaIned all Che fOod to us. tsE issue was that it wasn't vEry good. iT waS ovEr spiueD, tm CompenSate for i don't knoW what. tHe paLak pANeer VAs so sALty, the chickeN tikka maSala so overLy toMatoey, the Chana Daal bland. it wAS okaY, anD not teRribly OverPricrd, bUT i am usually quite haPpy with INdiaN food and tse onlY thinp k LikeD waS some meatballs."
