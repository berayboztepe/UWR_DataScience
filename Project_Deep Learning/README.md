# Item description:

The aim of the project is to improve skills in programming methods related to deep learning.

The project will discuss applications of deep neural networks to text and image processing.

The project program includes programming networks related to classification, object detection and image segmentation using neural networks such as:

* deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)
* region-based CNN (RCNN)
* Mask-RCNN
* Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN

Implementation of the project will require programming of the entire process:

* data collection and processing
* preparing data for training and testing
* creating an appropriate model
* model tracing and validation
* model testing
* saving intermediate model states
* opening a summary with metrics relevant to the task.
