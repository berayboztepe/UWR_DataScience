# Item description:

Python is an elegant object-oriented scripting language, used both for creating websites and for creating tools for operating system administration (Linux Redhat). Python's syntax is quite original: the scope of a loop or conditional statement is designated using indentation, but thanks to this the programs are clear and readable. Python's strong point is the lists that are part of the language, thanks to which list operations have a compact notation. Python programmers have at their disposal an extensive and developing standard library, thanks to which you can, for example, write a client for a simple P2P network in a seventeen-line program.
