# Item description:

Each meeting has two parts. During the first, students solve tasks typical (to a greater or lesser extent) for programming competitions such as AMPPZ, CERC, etc. In the second part, we discuss the methods of their solutions.

The aim of the classes goes far beyond the preparation of teams representing UWr in competitions. As many years of experience show, the classes significantly deepen the understanding of algorithms, improve programming proficiency and the ability to solve problems. These are probably the skills most often tested in recruitment by "top companies" (Google, Microsoft, etc.)

For some problems, I used code or guidance from editorials due to time constraints in Python or difficulties in building the algorithms myself.
