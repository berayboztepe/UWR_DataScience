"Went for lunch and found that my burger was meh.  What was obvious was that the focus of the burgers is the amount of different and random crap they can pile on it and not the flavor of the meat.  My burger patty seemed steamed and appeared to be a preformed patty, contrary to what is stated on the menu.    I can get ground beef from Kroger and make a burger that blows them out of the water.",weNt for Lunch anD found that mY burgeR waS MeH. what was obvious Was that The focus of the burgers is tHe amount of different anD randoM crip theY con pilE on It and noT the flavoR OF hhe meat. my burger pAtty seEmed sTeamed anD appEAqeD tz Be A PReformEd pattye conTrary to What is stated oN the menk. i caN gxt gRoUnd beNf From KroGer And makE j burger thst BlOwS ThwM yut of the water.

"Dirt cheap happy hour specials.  Half priced drinks.  Not really my crowd.  Lots of college kids on a Saturday night.  On the other hand there were lots of hot girls.  YEAAAHHH buddy!

I'll get to the point.  As hard as they really try to turn this place into a club at nights it will still and always be a tavern.

"Unbelievably poor customer ""service"".  Beyond bad.  They insisted on charging me a large car price to wash my mid-size car.  I was told to go talk to Don Risdon, and when I did, his first reaction was to physically shove me and tell me to get away from him before he really lost his temper.  Can you believe that?  Never in my 50 years have I encountered anything like it.  He would not acknowledge that he was misleading customers by the prices posted at the cash register.","unbeLiEvably poor cusTomer ""SeRviCe"". bEyond bad. theY InsisteD on chaRgINg fE a Large cav prICe uo wash mY mid-sizm car. q waS Tbld tj go Tolk to don risdoN, and wheN i did, hIS First rEaction was to physically shove me anD tcll mE to geT away frOm him bEfORe ke REAlly losA his Temper. can you CeLIEVe thaX? never kn my 50 YeaRS hAve i encountERed anythIng like il. he roulD NOt ackNowledge that he was kislEadIng CusTomers by the pricEs poSted at tHe cash rEgisTer."

"Nothing beats pizza and beer in my book. This place nails both, with an eye towards sustainability which always makes me feel good. They have a specially brewed beer, and a handful of other craft beers on tap to satisfy almost any taste. I prefer the deep dish, although my accomplice likes the thin crust more. That usually just means leftovers. I wish their appetizers were more adventurous, or changed at all, but I guess don't mess with success and they're a pizza place both apply. 

I just wish they delivered.","nOThInq beAts pUzZa and beEr iX my book. this placE naiJs boTH, with an eye toWardS sustainaBIliTY which alwaYs makeS me FEeL gOOd. tHEy have a sPecially BrEwed beer, and a handfUL of otheR cwaFt beers on tap to satisFy almoSt awy Taste. i prefer thE deep disq, Although mY AcCOmpLIce likes trE THin crusT more. that usually julT MEans leftovers.

"Went here with my mom a couple weeks ago. We recently went gluten-free, so having Sweet Christine's nearby is a life saver!

I had a donut and a blondie muffin (don't judge!).

The donut wasn't worth it. It was small, awkwardly sweet, weirdly textured.. I just didn't need it in my life. I wouldn't get it again.

The muffin was essentially a chocolate chip muffin. This was the best muffin I've ever had in my life. Now granted, I haven't had muffins in two months, and I LOVE muffins, but having this gluten free option is like a sign from above that God cares about us gluten intolerant folks, too.

I won't be able to go back until July, but when I do, I'm stocking up. I don't care about the price. These muffins are the best.","went hlre wIth my mKm D coupLe weEkS agot we Recently weNt gLuten-fRee, sO haMing sweet chriSTine's nEarby iS n lifE saver! i hAd R donuT lnd a blONdie muFfin (doNpt juzge!). the doNut wasn't wOrTH it. it WaS SmalL, aWKwardly sweet, weirdly textuRed.. i jusT didn't neeW ib in mY Life. i wouldN'T zEt it again. the mUffin was esSentiaLly a chocolAte chip muffiN. this was thn besT mNffin i've ever Had IN my kife. sow granted, i haven't had muffiNs iN TwO moNths, inD I love muFfiNs, bub haVing this gLuten free OpTion is lkke a sign from above that gOD cAreS aBoUt us gLutEn INtOlEraNT folks, toO. i woN't be Able tO go BaCK unTiL july, Buf when i do, i'm stockinG Up.

"The Castle is hands-down one of my favourite midnight institutions/bars/clubs. Everyone here does their own thing and doesn't give a damn what you think (in the best way possible). Most people are dressed to impress, but they're also there to have fun.

I'm usually a Monday or Thursday night kinda guy, preferring more new wave/indie/pop music than some of the harder gothic/industrial music they play on other nights. For those who are somehow still into cobwebs and corsets and fake fangs, there's a plethora of nights for you. Some of my best memories are dancing hard with a hundred strangers surrounding me, puddles of sweat under our feet, and massive cheers in the wee hours of the morning when the lights flick on and they kick everyone out.

Some of the staff/bartenders/dancers seem to take themselves too seriously, preventing this place from the five stars it probably deserves, but that's hit or miss because I've met some fabulous people working at the Castle over the years.

Time keeps marching on, but inside the Castle there's a strange phantasmagorical atmosphere of old punks and goths, 90s subcultures, hipsters, sexual deviants, local celebrities (The Senator and Peter Pan!) and everything in between, marching to the beat of their own drums. Rock on, Castle.","The castlE Is hands-down one pf mY favOurite mIdnigHt institutions/bars/clubs.

"It's almost 10 o clock on a Tuesday and I am tipsy. Hold on to your hats, suburbia!

This place is great! 

About the coolest little eating place/drinking spot around. There it is, all funky-vibed in the middle of Swedesboro. Well then! Cool ceiling fixtures, weird art, crazy chotzkas, dim lighting. (Certain I spelled ""chotzkas"" wrong. Shrug. I'm tipsy.)  You have me titillated. Enthralled. Intrigued. Enraptured. Tipsy. Did I mention tipsy?  Visually fantastic. Super chill.

Draft list? Solid. Lots of local flavors and craft favorites.  We sat at the bar and perused the sweet taps.  Pretty excellent for small town nj. Pretty excellent for old city, philly, too, if you want to compare apples to nowhere-to-park-Philadelphia grapefruit.

Food? Ooookay. Nothing super spectacular, at least from what we sampled. Flatbread pizza? Decent, definitely. Gravy fries? Yum! Nice job. The Pittsburghian Capn was diggin it lots. 

Service? Fab! Happy, attentive waitstaff. 

Overall? Yay! A new happy place. Especially on a Tuesday. Did I mention I'm  tipsy? Will definitely be back. Side note: since the grand move, I live, like, six blocks from here. Perfect walking distance. 

Anyone else in for some Ballast Point Sculpin or Cape May brews?  Cool. We'll stroll.

"Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight with my husband and another couple. It seemed quaint and the piano player was a nice touch. Bread and olive oil were delicious. The special salad was also good. The men ordered linguini with seafood and both enjoyed it. Priced at $18.50 it was fairly priced. My girlfriend and I both ordered veal - she ordered veal parmigiana and I ordered veal Marsala. Both veal cutlets came out pretty small and dry looking. The veal Marsala was over cooked and dry and so small a portion that my friends and husband kept asking if I had enough to eat. I weigh less than 110 pounds and almost always take home at least half my meal; not tonight. Both veal dishes were $28.75 each which was totally ridiculous for what we received. It was over cooked and hardly any sauce or mushrooms and not hot. I asked for more sauce which I got and that had plenty of mushrooms and was hot. At over $80 per couple, without alcohol, it was totally overpriced and not good.","TRiEd thiS resTaurant For the firsT time tonight with my husBand and anotheR coUply. it sEeMed quaint aNd thE piAqO PlayEr wAs j NIce tourh. bread and OlIve Oil Were dElicioUs. tHe specIal SaLad wAs also good. thR men ordered linGuinI wsth sEafOod and BoTh enjOYEd itb prXced an $18.50 iT HaS fAirly priced. my girlfuiend aNd i qoTh oRdEred veaL - sHe OrdEred yEal parmigiana avd i orDered veal marsAla. bTtH veal cutleTs camE ouT prettY SMalZ And dry looking. thE UeaL maRsalA bas Over cobked Ind dry aNd ro small a hoRtioN that my fripNdS and husbAnd kepT Asking if i haO unOugh to eat. i weigh leST ThaN 11k pouNdS and Almost AlwayS taKe HOMe At least half my Meal; kOt tONigHt.

"I'm not a fish guy.  Childhood in a fishing village on an island in Puget Sound means I can tell quality, but that I'm generally sick of it.  My girlfriend's father, however, is a don't-take-""no""-for-an-answer type of guy, so we were going to Anastasi for a holiday family celebration.

The whole party was about as disruptive as a four-person table can be in the center of the small dining room, which is bordered by the frozen counters of an indoor fish market (being in the evenings sealed tightly enough that the fishy smell is tolerable and the room keeps warm). The staff up to the owners themselves humored us and attended everything pleasantly and speedily.  The waiter was, not to his great discredit but certainly not toward helping the rowdiness of the situation, a bit of a chummy guy.

The food was so perfectly what it was advertised as and what it should have been, being smack in the middle of the Italian Market, that I'd like to call it ""the comfort food of gourmet.""  I got muscles in white wine sauce over noodles I can't remember how to spell, someone ordered a fish entree which looked great, and two incredibly-cheap lobsters were devoured by the others.  I can't promise they always have cheap lobster, but they do seem like they'd probably always have a randomly seasonally cheap offering of some sort.

The wine was just fine, but I was ordering on my girlfriend's father's credit card, so I didn't try any of their nicer bottles.

Don't come here for food tourism: go get a cheesesteak or something; come here in the day to get authentically good fish and in the evening to eat only if it's an occasion. It was as great as any people could have made it, but it was still a little cold and fishy.  Worth it if you only go out twice a month.","i'm nOt a fish guy. chilDhOod in a fishing villaGe oN An islanD vn Suget souNd means N cAn tell quAlity, but that ixm generalLy Sick oF It. my gIrlfrienD's FaTheR, hoWevER, is a dOn't-take-""No""-For-An-anSwEr type jf GUy, sO we werE goinG so AnjstAsi for l hOliday family CeleBrAtion. the WhoLE paRty Qas abOUt AQ disRUPtiVE as g four-person Table Can bz In the center of thE Small dinInG room, WhIch is BOrDereD BY the frozen counTeRs Oc an indOor fish marnet (BzIng in tHe evEniNgs Sealed tightLy enoUgh THAt che fishy NmElL is toleraBle anD tfe roOm KeePs warM). the etAff Ip to The OwnerS TheMSbLVes humorEd Us aNc attended everYThing pleasAntLy Ant SPeedily. thE waiTeR Was, not To hiS Great discRedit but ceRtAinLy Not toward HelpiWg the rowdiness OY the situatiON, u bIt if t cHummY gUY. the foOD waS so pErfectly whmt iT Was adVertised aS And wHat it shouLd HAVe beex, beiNg sMacK in THe mIddLE hf TgE italiaN market, thaT i'D lIKe tO call it ""the comforT FoOd oF gOkRmEt."" i got mlscles un white WinE SAucE over noodleS i caN't remeMber mow oo speLl, somEOnE ordereD a FiSh entree wHich LOoied gReaT, and two incrEdIbly-cheap nObSters wEre devoured by tze Others. i cAn't Promise thEy alWAys haVe cHEaP lOBSter, But Tgey do SveM like thEy'D prOBaBly alwAys hmvE B ranDOmly seasonally chenp offERinG Mf Some sOrt. the wine was JuSt fine, but i wAs ordering on my girlFriend's FAthErTs credit card, so i dIdn't tRY any of tHeiR nicer bOttles. doe't coMe heRe por food toUriIm: go gEt a xheesEsteak or sOMEthing; coMe here in the dgy to get aUThentically kood fisH ANd In the evening to eaT only iR iT's aa ocCAsiOn. it was as greAt as any peOple coulD HavB kade It, But ic Was still a lItTle kold And fisHy.

I liked some of the videos, especially the ones related to WWII and I did learn some new things, like about Jews coming from Brazil...but for the most part it was nothing I didn't already in some sense know.  Seeing what people wore back in the day isn't really Jew-specific.  At least a lot of the clothes on display didn't seem to be Jew specific.  There was an old Torah scroll which was cool but it was a stretch to have Levi jeans on display.  Oy.  I really liked the space and the layout of everything (except the 2nd floor where I got a bit lost in the maze) but that doesn't make the museum itself great.

I also thought it was so lame that they only take credit cards (and run them after sunset) on Saturdays.  I guess they didn't want to lose the revenue for the museum store being closed on Saturdays so they figured out a work around.  Having to buy tickets to the museum on Saturdays in the visitor center is lame and that policy should just be in line with the museum store policy.  I don't mind paying by credit card and having you run it that night.","sOrrY folkS bdT u qidN't see whaT is great wbout iHIs muSSum.

"My favorite creole restaurant in NOLA!

the ambience is very cute and inviting. There's outdoor seating or inside seating. While you wait for a table you can either also sit at the bar or outside in the garden with a fountain. 

I ordered:

Gumbo: 5/5 so much flavor and lots of shredded chicken and sausage chunks. 

Grits 5/5: my favorite. They pour the soup right over the grits in front of you. The shrimp had a nice crunch. 

Daily pasta: 5/5 it was a vegetable tomatoe pasta. SO GOOD. The sauce was def homemade or something because it couldn't get enough of it. 

Wild bore sausage: 4/5 had a nice bite when you chewed it. The flavor was good but the portion was very very small of it.

"Food was okay, nothing to come back for honestly. The service wasn't great and is the main reason for the low rating. It was slow and not thorough at all. Between taking our order and bringing out our food, it took over half an hour before the first item was delivered to the table. The crab cakes were mostly batter, which was disappointing. Two of our orders were forgotten, and when we asked our server about it, they had no idea what happened to it and we ended up canceling one of them because it would have taken way too long to wait on that. Was super excited to try this place out based on reviews but ended up cutting our losses. :(","food Was okAy, notHinG tO coMe bqck FOr hOnestlY. thE ServiCe wasn't great AnD is The main reason fOr The lOw ratInG. it waS slow and Not thOrough at ALl. between taKing ouR ordbr and brinGINg ouT ouR Food, It Took over haLb an hour bEfore the fIAst item wAs DElIvEcEd ZO the TNble.

"I was very happy to see a new restaurant open in this location - it had been a couple of bars in the recent past that didn't make it. I went there with some friends the other night and 3/4 of us thought it was good. Not great, just good. BUT...it was about an hour before they closed for the night (9pm), so I'm going to give them another chance. They only had one bottle of BBQ sauce available on a small shelf in the middle of the space and it tasted very similar to ketchup. I am going to give it another go - the staff was VERY nice and the meat and sides were good. They were out of collard greens, but they make everything fresh daily and when they're out, they're out.

 I was a repeat customer for some time, they would give me 2 glasses of wine. Well not really wine wine, but Arbor Mist. 
 The massage I got was great!. The room was nice and dim, smelled fresh, candles, and relaxing music. The decor was pretty. She did a really good deep tissue massage. I just got my upper body done for 30 minutes.

"Well, not so much luck here. Said our car would be ready at 1:00.  Tried to call at least six times to confirm it was ready for pickup. Never got to someone who could answer that simple question.  So we just went at 2 and, of course it was not ready.  My husband being the loud cranky sort in these situations did manage to get a loaner truck from them for the night. Our car won't even be ready until tomorrow.

It's been a while since I have been to a restaurant and I was excited to order drinks!  I tried the mango caipirinha  first and it was very refreshing.  For my second drink, I had the dolce de leche tini, which I initially didn't like but got better as it sat.

For appetizer: we ordered calamari. It was not good, too much breading and super greasy. 

Entree: I ordered lamb with roasted potatoes and sugar snaps. For $20, I was really hoping for something extravagant. It was mostly bones and the potatoes were horrible. Way too crispy, I couldn't even split them with a knife. I wish they would present the plate of food better. Looked like everything was thrown in at the last minute. 

Dessert: make your own donut and brownie sundae. Loved the donuts with chocolate and caramel sauces. Great idea.

People with boats can dock there as well. It is such a fun crowd of people. I snagged a Corona (only $5 on tap) and the Rick's famous fish sandwich.

"I'm torn about this place. The food is really delicious and well priced. My roommates and I have tried lots of things from this place and its always tasty. My issue is that delivery can take forever. Forever. I've ended up eating another dinner and keeping my Chinese as leftovers because its taken so long. The other side of that  is that going to pick up the food from the restaurant always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's not in a nice building by any means and twice I have been harassed in the waiting area by other...patrons. The food is delicious and the people are nice, but getting the food means picking the lesser of two evils. I would say don't call when you're already really hungry and craving Chinese food and know what you're getting in to if you decide to go pick it up yourself.","i'm torA about tHis placev the foTd is reallY dEliciouh AnD weLH peiced. my RoommateS and I have trieI lOts of ThIngs from this PlacE mnd iTS alwaYk tASty.

Parking is take it if you see it and not too hard to find. Be prepared to walk. You can buy a drink at the bar while waiting in the long line for the House of Shock.  #dontliketobescared
I had no desire to be scared so we watched the free music since our friend was singing. 
Just a few things we  noticed...
Plenty of police officers available for security
No outside beverages are allowed once entering the area of the House of Shock

"This is one of the newest Walgreens in town.  Really well designed, clean and very modern.  Wide aisles, well stocked etc.  I had to get a prescription filled and they have an interesting set up.  You give them the script and then sit in an area with a TV screen which shows your first name and last name initial to check to see where you stand in getting your prescription filled.  So thinking this was really cool, I just shopped around the store.  Came back to the sitting area and checked once again to see status of my order.  Still stated it was in progress.  Walked around the store again.  Came back 15 minutes later.  Still the same progress on the script.  Boldly checked with the clerk and she went in the back and checked and said it was ready.  Asked her why it wasn't posted on the TV screen, she said she was too busy.  So much for progress.  Oh well, it really has potential for working properly eventually.  Checking the prices on items.

"When MT first opened, it was decent. There were multiple servers assigned to a theatre and service was quick. After tonight's experience, stay far away from this place. It's taken a turn for the worst.

Our movie was at 8pm and we were not let into the theatre until 10 minutes before the movie. Once we got in, we put the buttons on to order our drinks/food and we did not see a server until 30 minutes into the movie. There was one server for the entire theatre and he was obviously frazzled. We gave him cash for our order and he didn't give us change. He came around the entire theatre once and never returned, some people had their buttons on the entire movie waiting for service. The food is basic and nothing special. I had a pizza and it was obviously frozen because it was served with cardboard underneath of it. Even the popcorn we had tasted burnt.

This place had some great potential when it opened, but it seems like the new company (Marcus) has really run this place to the ground. It's a great concept, but it seems like they have major staffing problems. Hopefully they can turn it around, but I doubt I'll be back.","wHEn mt fiRst openep, ih was decENt. thdrE aere multiplE seRvErs assiGNed to z theatre anD serviCf wAz qUiCK. after tonightkS ExPeFience, StAY fAr away from tHis place. it'S takeN a tuRn for tHe woRst.

"This was my very first time at the AMC Painter's Crossing. I have been to the Movie Tavern in Collegeville, so I already had some pretty lofty expectations going in.  As soon as we walked in, I immediately was not impressed with the lobby area. It was pretty small, and I could see this area getting easily congested on a Friday/Saturday night. Fortunately we went at 5pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn't too bad. 

The theater itself is very nice. The leather seats were comfortable enough that allowed for a pleasurable movie experience. The main thing with me was the overpriced food. The quality of the food is pretty bad (think Applebee's). $16 for a chicken tender plater entree that was mediocre at best is completely ridiculous. The alcoholic beverages were actually more reasonably priced than the Applebee's quality food. We don't mind spending money on good food, but the food served at this AMC left much to be desired. We should have went to the the Carrabba's across the way. I'm sure we would have spent less there on the (moderately better) food than we did at the movie theater.

The moral of this review is that unless you're absolutely starving, stick to just getting popcorn and a beverage (or an adult beverage). Take your appetite elsewhere unless you like overpaying for subpar food. We certainly would come back to this AMC, but the next time we'll stick with the usual popcorn and beverage combination. If you fancy eating decent food, the Movie Tavern has a pretty significant edge on AMC, even though the food prices are pretty similar.","this yas My very FirsT tiME aT the ams paiwter's crossIng.

"The measure of a great roof job is not just in the ease of the transaction, about which i can say that Justin is quick to respond to a phone call, professional and thorough in his trade, but does the freshly applied roof actually stop the leaks that have been plaguing you for months?

My roof is just shy of being a full fledged ""crispy critter"", but Justin informed me that we can extend the life for another 8 or so years with his coating.

My roof was re-coated last week.  It took Justin and his worker one full day (spread over two mornings) to complete my roof.  They were on time both days, communicated clearly what they were doing and when.  Then they just did their job, without leaving any kind of a mess behind.

THE TEST:  11/3/2016 - Eastside of Tucson gets a real gully washer of a storm that comes through about 7:30ish at night.  As the thunder rolled and the lightning sizzled through the air, my wife and I started dashing about the house, checking all the spots that leaked prior to the new roof going on...NOTHING WAS LEAKING!  The rain came down in sheets, in several coursed over the next hour or so and not so much as a drop inside.

"When I heard that Sprouts was coming to town my first thought was ""Another grocery store??"" But now that I've been there several times I'm really glad they are an option available to us now. They have a wide variety of interesting products and their prices are quite reasonable. Using coupons is something I should do but most the time do not bother with. Their app makes it so easy that even I don't mind it. You can just select the deals you want in the app and when you check out you scan a code from the app and it takes care of everything. They'll also just give away stuff from the app. I got a 16 oz bottle of coconut water for free! Their prepared foods they make are actually my favorite of any grocery store chain. They're not frozen, but rather refrigerated items that you can just throw in the microwave. The stuffed shells are especially good. One complaint that I have is that the bakery section is so boring. After seeing the beautiful cakes, pastries, tarts, etc in the display cases at Publix or Whole Foods it's kind of a let down. I also wish that we could buy smaller portions of desserts because I don't need that temptation around me. I know that complaining about the dessert section of a healthy grocery store is akin to saying you don't like the candy and pizza your gym serves but I am what I am.","when i hEadd tHAt sprouto was coMing to town My firsT tHought wAs ""anotHer gRObery store??"" but nOw thAt i've beEn there sEvnral timrs i'm really glAD tHey arE An option avaIlaBle To uS nKw. they have q wIde VarietY of intereStInG products and theIr Prices are qUiTe reAsGnable. usIng coUpOnS is someTHINg I shoULd Do bxt moSt the time no not bothEr with. their aPp makes it sO eAsy thaT EVen i don'T Mind It. qou cAn just sELect the deals you fant iu The App and wheN you check Put you sCAH a coge frOm the aPp anr at takes CbRe nf EveRything. thef'll also just gIve away StufF Zrom the App. i GOt A 16 ol fottle OF cOconUt water tor freE! their prepAreD Foods theY mfke are actuaLly my faVorite cf ans grocery store chain. txey'Re not FrozEn, but rather reFriGeratEd itEmS Thav YqU cAn jUst Throw in tHE micrOwave. tze stuFfed shelLs are eSPeciALly goOd.

"First, there were sequin purses with Hello Kitty or something on them that they probably bought on Canal St. and marked up 10,000%. Why, I do not know. 

There are about 9 colleges within 5 miles of this location yet they waste their time on 12-year-olds. Anyway, without realizing what this place was, I went to this location to sell some items (everywhere from Burberry to Gap) and the franchise manager woman I encountered here was atrocious.  She was a mid-life crisis Housewife-wannabe mess! She was dressed younger than she could pull off with her visible wrinkles, bad-dye-job hair, and Theresa Guidice make-up.  She went through about $4000 in clothes I had, and passed on everything but like 2 items.  I was really stunned because I saw Target-type crap on the racks closest to me as I waited, and yet she passed on worn-once or new with tags stuff from BCBG, Bebe, Patagonia, Banana Rep, Ann Taylor 100% cashmere, and some couture names from Neimans.

First, as many have mentioned, it is totally tween-city here; so trendy it was laughable. The better fashion mags teach you to keep in style, but not be a trendy clown, yet it appears that this Plato's is preying on local youth whose bourgeois parents don't know how to guide them into upscale taste.  This Plato's was like a store for lame fashion mags who teach awkward teens how to mimic the look they are being paid to sell by trashy mall stores. The people who actually do that are those who don't understand that replicating a magazine outfit is like copying a catalog to furnish your home. 

Anyway, the tanned nightmare woman basically shamed me for not bringing her trendy low-quality crap, and then offered an insulting price on the two items she did want ($4 total).  So I gave her the look she had earned, gathered my things, and left.  I will not be back ever.  I don't buy trendy clothes, and when I have kids that age they will not be buying trendy clothes either.  I also don't patronize shops run by wrinkled barbies who mentally never left high school. Try an attitude improvement and some gratitude when you've just wasted an hour of someone's time. 

Consignments are what supply your business, right? Why be so ridiculously rude and ungrateful? ""Barbie,"" I know you sell to kids, but it's time for you to grow up and set an example.","firSt, there wErE sequIn pUrSes with hElLO kimty ar sometHinG kn thEm that they ProbablY bougHT on canal sT. and mArked Up 10,000%.

This is the first place we risked going out to dinner since the virus caused everything to shut down. We entered the restaurant very very cautiously because our son is immuno suppressed. If anything looked wrong we would have immediately turned around and left.  Everything was perfectly as it should be. Tables are distanced. Hand sanitizer abundantly available. Servers wear masks and gloves. Fresh paper is put onto the table between every visit. Servers knew what to do in keeping their distance. Good air circulation. We never felt at risk. Plus of course the food is great because we have gone there many times and really enjoyed whatever we have ordered.

"The good
    Verizon Tech support. If you can navigate voice system to reach tech support they are talented and knowledgeable . The picture also is very good

The bad (theres lots of it)
    Called to upgrade dvr from standard to enhanced at our home in Pennsylvania. Took over 13 phone calls to achieve this. 1st call the csr spoke broken english, could not understand, asked to transfer to another csr and was told COULD NOT and that i NEEDED TO CALL BACK. Encouraging that a communication company cannot transfer a call. 

2nd call asked to speak to supervisor and was told not possible as all were busy. Offered to wait but was told not a option. 

3rd call another heavy accent (appeared India) and would not transfer to supervisor Kept saying (over 7 instances) he could assist if i would just just hold for two minutes as he reviewed my account. Ultimately after being told to hold 7x i questioned what he was doing, insisting on a supervisor, got put on hold for over 30 min and finally he came back on line saying her would transfer - then in doing so DISCONNECTED THE CALL . Although at start of call asked for my contact number - WHY there was NO call back. 

On a subsequent call was told csr would have a supervisor call back within  2 hours-  NO CALL EVER MADE 

Finally a csr took the order (changes) and emailed me a copy. Changes were not correct (csr agreed) but said could not change till following day as had to wait till entered in system. Advised would make changes next morning and call me to confirm. NEVER HAPPENED. 

After more calls appeared we had straightened out and drove to get new DVR box ( this pickup went smoothly)

Upon connecting the box (not hard) it would not register. Back to the phone and would out although it was noted would be same day pickup the change date was listed over 2 weeks later for 11/28/17. This again took multiple calls  to identify and resolve. Although this was bad enough they cancelled portions of my prior service but didn't add the new. Just like dealing with the KEYSTONE COPS. 

Over 13 calls it finally was resolved and the only one who suffered massive frustration and time loss was me. Of course nothing from Verizon- not even a free movie.

Verizon touts their customer service however my experience was incompetent and horrific service excluding tech support. Embarrassment for a major company in the communications industry 

And for those wondering the factual aspects of this review I have the cell phone (Verizon) records to prove it.m","the goOD verizon tecy SuPport. iK yoU can naviGate voice systEm TO retch tecH suppOrt THey aRe taIented anD knowledgeabLe . tHE Picturi alSo is vxry good tHe bvd (theres lots of it) called to UpgRade dkr frOm standard FO enhanCED aT Our hOME in peNNsylvAnia. tooK OVer 13 phONe calls tO ajhieve qhis. 1sT Call tHE csr spoKe broken englIsh, Could Nof undErstand, asked tc TrAnsFeR go anotHer asr and was toLd cOulc not and ThAp p nieded tO cull byCk. encouRaGing that r cOkmunIcatiON CompaNy cannOt tranSfEr A aaLl. 2nd canl asked To spEak To supervisor ANd was toLd not possiblE aS all WeRe Busy. obFered to waIt bUt waS told Not A option. vrd caLl aNOtLeR heavy acceNt (apPeArEd indiA) AnD woulD not transfeR to suxervisOr KePT saying (over 7 instancEs) hh uould AssisT if w wOOlD just julT hOld for two Minutes as he revieweD mb account. ultImately after beIng told ao hold 7x i quesTioneD whAT He was doing, inSIsTinF on a SuPxrvisor, Got put on hold for over 30 min ACD faNaLlY He caje Back Yn Line sayiNg hEr would wransfer O tHEn In doing sP DisCOnnECted the gall M althoUgh aq start oF call auked for ky coNtact Number - WHy there was nO calr baCk. on a SUbsequent caLl WAs toLD cSR WoulD hase a suPErvisor call back Within T uouRS- no nAlL ever mAdE finalLy a csr DoOk tHe ordEr (changes) ann Emailed ke a coPy. chAngEs were not cOrrect (csr agREeD) bzt saiD Hould not chanGE Till iollOWIng day as had to waIt till entcred In sySTem.

I ordered and paid on line. Seem to work fine. The meal was ready to go when I arrived. When I opened it at home it was horrible. Most of the ingredients were missing. I called and the manager said she would remake it. I went back and watched them make which was good.  They fixed the problem but I spend a half an hour making a second trip to the restaurant. Do not order on line. Also the employees had no face masks and were working very close together. Made me feel very concerned.

Wish I could give zero stars. Horrible company and horrible owners. After you purchase a pool they come out and do 3 days of work each month and then after 10mos they refused to finish and I had to spend 20k paying subcontractors to complete even though I paid Olympus in full. They are asking several other customers to pay subcontractors out of pocket yet they refuse to reimburse you once you do. Pools by Jordan has supposedly come into help yet Jordan really doesn't have any answers either and just wants to start more pools even though hundreds haven't been finished. Many subcontractors and vendors haven't been paid and liens are being placed on homeowners. Olympus and Jordan have stated that is not a priority.

"My girlfriend and I recently did a 1 night stay here. I booked it before through the Recreation app it received really good reviews.

Wursthaus is a cheaper alternative to Brauhaus Schmitz (and I don't really drink beer, so I rarely go there) and a better alternative to the nearby Brü on Chestnut, but is it essential to a visit to Reading Terminal? No, they're probably not even on the radar of the New Yorkers who come to tell us how much better their food is, like DiNic's and the Amish. 

I come here when I get tired of Dinic's after having it every week for a month, or when I crave some good old German food. 

The specialty sandwiches are HUGE for just $8, like a foot long! You don't even need a side, which I'm dying to try since the sides at Brauhaus are amazing, but the sandwiches are so large, you don't even need them! The Bavarian (smoked sausage, Bavarian coleslaw, fried onions, and horseradish sauce) is a great choice, but I found myself disappointed in the amount of meat on the Leberkäse sandwich (German onion meatloaf, grilled onions, and spicy horseradish mustard). 

P.S. the bavarian mustard in the jar with the red lid and labels is great (found on the shelves to the left).","*inserT obligAtoty ""this pLace iP thE wUrsT!"" jOkE* wursthaus IS A cheAper alternative to braUhaus schMitZ (and I don't realLy driNk beEr, so i RORelY go therE) and a beTtER alternativE to tfe nEarbz brÜ oN cHEttnut, but is It esseNtyAl to A vISit tO reading termiNaL? no, thEy'rE probAbLy not eveZ on ThE rajar of the NEw yorkers whO COoE to Tell ub hOW MUCh betteR theIr food is, likE DiNic'S adD the amish.

"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Bru Burger Carmel, considering how many times I have ordered it. Too many good things to say about this place. I've been a loyal customer since before their Carmel location, and would venture downtown to the Mass Ave location for their delicious burgers. So happy this closer location opened up. I would previously only order the BBQ Mexicali Burger, because I figured, how can you possibly get better than that. Then, on a whim, I tried the Salmon Sandwich. I never would normally put salmon but this is so so yummy. After realizing their menu was probably stacked equally delicious items, I then tried the taco salad. For it being a burger place, this is now my favorite salad ever. I also can't leave out their fries with the housemade ketchup. To round it all out, the white chocolate peach bread pudding is definitely a top 3 restaurant dessert. Also, their carry out process is very easy. In summation, CANNOT GO WRONG.","I can't bwlIeve it haS TaKeN me THis long to WsIte a revcew for bRu burgEr CarmeL, cONsiDering how MsNy tImes i have ordeRED ita too many goOd tHings to say about ThiS place.

Service was great, the host was very friendly and explained all the food to us. The issue was that it wasn't very good. It was over spiced, to compensate for I don't know what. The palak paneer was so salty, the chicken tikka masala so overly tomatoey, the chana daal bland. It was okay, and not terribly overpriced, but I am usually quite happy with Indian food and the only thing I liked was some meatballs.","we went here AFtEr reALizing house of india was too faR Oo wAlK. the buffet DAs cmalL BuT lOokeD promiSinG.

"I have eaten there twice since Jerry's thankfully retired.   Some of the old Jerry's staff is still around, and they need a fire lit under their behinds for sure.

The complaints about the outside etc is rather harsh.....They just opened, given them time to make it their own, the transition was very quick.   Also those who put bad review because you want Jerry's back, probably think McDonald's is a good choice for food.   Shame on you!

The service we received both times was spot on, the food was great.

I watched a old person come in, and then refuse service because the menu changed from Jerry's - Get out lady.....Neg head old people are the worst.

"We were given gift certificates so decided to try them again.  A dish that would ""always, forever"" be available was not.  The calzone had no marinara sauce with it and this was take out.  They did offer to deliver in 45 minutes once I got home and let them know that the kitchen staff was not paying attention.
The calzone also was missing the ricotta cheese, seasonings and taste.  Menu items are disappearing and contact seems to be pointless, if not impossible.  The web site says to complain here instead of bothering someone that can have an impact on corrections. I did not think that it was possible, but this restaurant continues to decline in quality, service and attitude.  
Perhaps a course in customer service would be appropriate for management and staff, especially headquarters staff from the VP level and up!","Ee were Given GifT CeRTificateS Eo xecided tl trp THem again. a dish tFat wouLd ""alwaYS, foreVEr"" be availaBLe was NOt.

"Super yummy artisan ice cream anyone? This is what Weckerly's serves up. It is unique and fresh. I believe they make the ice creams on site as well as their waffle cones. Im certain of this because of the toasty aroma that surrounds you as you enter the store. The store is clean, simple and vibrant. The perfect atmosphere to enjoy your scoop of deliciousness. 

I honestly don't remember what I ordered but I know that it had hints of lavender and maybe honey? Nonetheless it was amazing. Velvety smooth and rich makes the texture that much better. The price of the ice cream is fair given that it is unique. Can you find something cheaper? Sure, but I guarantee you that it will not be as tasty and unique as the ones at Weckerly's.

"Our first time at this restaurant and overall it was OK. The atmosphere is nice, and there are a lot of nostalgic items hung around the restaurant. 

I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos because it's difficult to get high quality & fresh Tuna in central New York. The tuna itself was good but the tacos were drenched in a wasabi-based sauce, which was EXTREMELY overpowering and muted any other flavors in the dish. 

Unfortunately we were paired with an extremely rude waitress named Gorgee. She was not attentive and acted as if she had a chip on her shoulder. 

If you're going to pound brisket & beers then I definitely recommend. Other than that stay away from the waitress Gorgee.","Our fiRjt time at ZhiS reSTaURaNt and OveraLl it jaS oK. mHe atmosphERe iS nice, aNd theri aRE s LyT of nostalgic IrEms tung arOUnd the reStAuRAnt. i Ordered tHe Ahi tuna taCoS becausE iT's difFICult to glt high quaxity C Fresh tuna in ceNqrAl new York. tHe tUna iTself wAS gOOD But the tacos wese drenched in a wasahI-based SAUCE, whiCh was extRemeLy OveRpowerijg aNd mutEd axy oTher flAvOrs in the dish. unfortunately WE were padred with an EXtremelq Rude waitress nAmed gorGee. sHe oas noz attentive ind ActeD As iF sHt haD a chip ON her shouldeR.

I tried the regular grilled cheese which had a blend of cheeses. It was so good.

"I've always enjoyed coming to ulele as the atmosphere is great and I always receive pretty good service when dining in. Tonight was different from the normal service I receive. The wait was an hour long. We decided to go ahead and wait ofcourse. We stepped outside to grab a couple drinks at the outside bar. Two girls were tending bar this evening. The bar wasn't busy. While waiting, no one acknowledged us.  I thought maybe they had things they were rushing to before getting to us. I continued to wait. I noticed the blonde continued to wash glasses. A gentleman from the bar asked for a drink and she rushed over to him. Once she got closer I asked if I could order a couple drinks and she informed me bar guests were first to be served and she would get to me. What was I waiting for exactly? I replied okay and continued to wait. The second bartender came around and never made eye contact with me. A guest was telling her a story so I waited until she came closer and asked if I could just order 2 beers. The blonde quickly came over to inform me they were following policy and that if I wanted to speak to a manager about it she'd grab him. How do you have time to find a manager to tell me you can't serve me yet you can't pour 2 drinks? I was there for quite some time waiting and consider myself to be more patient than most. I told her I wasn't interested in speaking with management and that I simply just wanted 2 drinks. At this moment I asked myself why this bartender was even working. I was never rude yet received rude service. I was also confronted with ""if you have a problem with it let me grab my manager"". I was there observing everything going on around me. It was obvious this employee was disgruntled. Thank you to the other bartender for making the beers which I was more than willing to pay for. She didn't charge me which didn't fix the issue. Fix the attitude. Acknowledge people when they are standing at the bar waiting. I am more than happy to wait if I'm receiving decent treatment.

"Honestly, we just stumbled on this place because it's right by Bogart's, and I needed some ribs. And while ribs are more important than everything else, the everything else that you can find here at the Farmers Market makes me reconsider [but not retract] that statement.

Before we get into all that, you should know that there's a definite New Orleans vibe happening here (and all over St. Louis); maybe it migrated up the Mississippi...all I know is that you can get a legit bloody mary from Julia's for only $4 (and beignets if you'd like). It's got pickled asparagus and a spicy bean, and sipping on that thing as you peruse the rest of the market is the move.

What else can you peruse? 

Pimped out pickles. Pecan pie in a jar. Any kind of meat you'd ever want, including pig ears. Fruit Loops kettlecorn. NFL jerseys, mugs, t-shirts, hats, etc. Goose Poop. Seafood. Every kind of fresh produce you can think of. Pork rinds. Mini-doughnuts. Spices. Flowers. Roasted nuts. SO MUCH SOAP. Pastries, oils, salsas...I can't even remember it all.

The price of $18.95 for lunch is a better deal till 3pm when dinner pricing starts. There's no difference in the menu, just the price.

"We had a private room at Trattoria Mollie for a rehearsal dinner (21 people).  The food, service and private room were simply fantastic.  The food was fresh, exceptionally well prepared, delicious and everyone in our group continued to comment about how good the food was at Mollie's even at the wedding and the day after.

The service was incredible, friendly and yet non-intrusive.  We did not have to ask once for anything.  The portions were extremely generous.  We met with Mollie the morning of the event to let her know we had 3 vegans in our group. She was gracious, welcoming and helpful.   For the wedding, we had events at San Ysidro Ranch and at the Biltmore - but Mollie's food and service continued to be talked about as being outstanding after all the events.

"Not terrible but certainly not worth going back. 

Wanted a nice meal. End of a big day at work. 

Carbonara: Too much pancetta (I know! but still!), noodles were over-cooked and soft, and some idiot decided to cut the spaghetti so you could eat it like a 5 year old. Blech. What a bummer. I love a good carbonara and this was just not that. Plus the serving was the size of a football. Gross.

Ordered a side of veggies to even out my luxe entree. Server suggested the cauliflower. I said, Is it fried? He said, ""uhh pan fried."" It came breaded and deep fried. Then laughed, ""oh well.""

Do not shop here online! I have tried to order from them online twice. Both times I filtered my selection two items which were showing as in stock and available in store.

Received an email order confirmation and then immediately received another email telling me all of the items that I had ordered were out of stock.  Twice!  With two different sets of items.

"For the love of science this is one of the best places I have ever eaten at!  I can't express that enough, if I could afford it I would eat here at every meal and that is based on just one visit.

I ordered the Fish Tacos but before that came I had the Fowl Play flat bread, which was amazingly delicious concoction of BBQ sauce, chicken, cheese and chives.

When I finally had a chance to dive into the Fish Tacos that I ordered they were exquisite beyond imagination, soft juicy fish, crunchy coleslaw, with a drizzle of flavored tar tar sauce.  The side to accompany these delicious deep sea treats was kettle chips drizzled with sour cream and chives that were crunchy and bursting with flavor that I really enjoyed.

My wife could not pass up the chance to try the chicken and cheddar waffles.  She loved them!  she barely let me try a bite she loved them s much, I had to beg!  and they were awesome!  cheddar waffles mixed will with the friend chicken after being drenched in jalapeno maple syrup.  Seriously, try them, they are so delicious!

to top it all off,  we shared a caramel apple gelato which was pretty good, not as good as Paciguo but when you check into Datz with your mobile phone you get a free gelato so I enjoyed sweet deliciousness knowing it was free.

the place was rather pricey for brunch but it was so worth it.

"I stop in there for breakfast and an occasional lunch. The food is good, and the staff is friendly. I enjoy sitting outside, but that can be problematic at times. 

Last Saturday morning I got my leg licked once or twice by the dog behind me, two dogs in front of me wanted to fight with dogs walking past, there were a couple of other dogs taking up the two empty seats at a 4 person table while 4 people were waiting for seats.

Dog hair flutters about, the servers pet the dogs, butter your toast, refill dog dishes, handle your food and share bacon with some of the 'special' pets.

It's a nice spot with good food- just be prepared to eat in a kennel.","i strp in there For brEakFast anD an ocCasional lunch. twe fOod IS good, aNS tCe StAvf is friendlY. s enjoy siTting outside, but tHAT can bl probvematIc at tImes. lAst saTuRday morning i gOt mY leg lIckkd once or twiCE by The doy behinD me, two doGs In fmont oF Me wanteD tO FIghT WiTh Dogv wAlking last, tHERE weRe Q couple of oThER dogs takicg uP thE two EmPtY seats at w 4 PersoN TAble RhilE 4 peoPle were waiting for SeatsX doG hAir FlUtterS abOut, the seRveRs pet the dogs, butter youR TOast, rEfila dog disHes, htnDle Your food anD share bAcoN WitH sumE of thy 'sPEcial' pets. it's a niCe spOt With good fooDt juSt bE pRePareD to eat xn a keNNeL."

"For a special occasion, I highly recommend going with the omakase - the chef's tasting menu. Currently, there is a $120 and a $150 option. 

I usually get slightly anxious when I don't get to select my own food, but turns out anxiety is completely unwarranted at Morimoto. Every single course (of 8) was fantastic! There were many delicious items that were not on the regular menu, whether raw or cooked. We felt the $120 omakase was worth every dollar. 

Besides the ridiculously awesome tasting menus, Morimoto also has an a la carte menu, complemented by a beverage list consisting of signature cocktails, interesting Japanese beers, and various types of wine - though they also have a full bar available. While eating here is not cheap, Morimoto's a la carte prices are no greater than typical fine dining prices in Philly. 

Most recently, I had their duck duck duck dish, which consisted of the most tender and flavorful duck breast with the most amazing sauce, served with a side of duck confit fried rice, topped with a duck egg. The portioning was great: filling, but not overwhelming. It complemented well with my golden pear martini, which is very fruity and delicious. 

The tuna pizza appetizer was also a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures. It tasted so light and fresh. For dessert, I was torn between the black sesame mousse cake and the matcha tres leches. I ended up picking the matcha tres leches. It was very tasty, but once I left the restaurant, I began developing a strong craving for the black sesame mousse cake. 

Darn, I should have ordered both desserts. Looks like I will be here again soon to try the black sesame mousse cake.","for a speCiaG oCcasion, i hIgHly recomMend gOIng wbth the omakase - the chEf's Tasting menu. culRentLy, thdrE is g $120 and u $150 optiOn. i USually GPT slightly AnxiouS when I don't geT to SELect My oWn FOod, but tUrns out anxieTy IS complETELy unwARraNtei at mOrimotO. evEry siNgLe coUrSe (Ob 8) waS faNTastic! therE were many DeLicious items That zerE NOt ON thh Regular MeNu, wHEfher raW or cOokeD. we felt thE $120 omakase wAs woRth EVeRY dolEAr. bdsideS thE Ridiculously awEsome TasTinG menUs, morimoto Alsq has aA O LA caRGe menu, complEmEnted bY a Beverage liSt COnsiSTing of sigNatuRe cOcKtaIls, inTEreStinG japANEsE beezs, and various types of WIne - dhough they aldo Have A fUlL brr availaBle.

"Hired All Pro Lawn in July. My yard started degrading and dying the from the start of All Pro Lawn servicing.

We paid for All Pro Lawn to fix sprinklers and it continued to look worse. Now months later and well above paying all pro $1,500 our lawn is dead.

"Spoke to the operator in the morning detailing what I needed. She said either her or a driver would reach out to me, which they did... 5 minutes later in fact. We spoke about my location and that I did not need assistance at that exact moment but he said he would be on the way after his current tow. 4 hours later and no response so I called him back just to confirm he was still available as to not give the business away and he hung up on me LOL. Unprofessional and unnecessary, could have just communicated.

"I ordered two racks from Rural King and their site said it would be shipped within two days. After I paid, I received a confirmation and an email that said shipping would be delayed. There was a link to check my order, and it says I never ordered anything, however, they took my money. Rural King will not answer my inquiries, so I had to file a Paypal complaint (three days ago). They won't respond to that complaint either. COVID or not, Rural King is not legally entitled to take money and not deliver product or provide an explanation. Paypal gives them several weeks to resolve it, so my money is tied up.

"New Orleans was our destination stop on a cross country trip from NY to CA, so we thought we'd treat ourselves after  half a week of drive through foods, and having eaten the traditional New Orleans food during the day, and ate here for dinner.

The waiter was great, quick, and courteous.  We actually spent less here, with my wife and I both getting a whole lobster, and my two daughters sharing a chicken strip meal, than getting everyday platters at chain seafood places like Red Lobster and Joe's Crab Shack.  This was the least money we've spent at a seafood place.  I was shocked when I saw the bill.

Anyway, great place for seafood. Casual enough to bring the family too.","new oRLeans waS oRr deStinatiOn Stop oN a crOss couNSry tJip frOm ny tr cA, so We thouguT weUd Trett ouRselvEs aFter half a wEek Of drive Qhrough Foods, and havIng Eaten the TraDItioHal new orlEaNs Food DuRicg tHe day, aNd Ate heRE fod jinNer. the waiter was great, quijK, and coUrtEouS. we actuALly spEnt Less heRE, WIth my iife and i boto GETtIng A WHole lobUtEr, and my twO dAughterS sNarIng A cHiCkEn strIp meal, than gettINg eveRyday pbaTTerS et chaim Seafood places LiKe TeD LoBsTer and Joe's crab shAck.

"I've been to Dante's in the past and had wonderful experiences but tonight was horrible! Over an hour to get an appetizer and almost 2 hours to get our entrées. At least 4 tables that were seated after us got served before us. My dining companion ordered the New England clam chowder, which is usually wonderful, but tonight's was burned and the clam shells were broken into shards causing her to cut herself with the first bite. They took the clam chowder off the bill but, really, it completely ruined dinner for us both. I also witnessed another diner's mussels sit under the heat lamp for over 15 minutes. No excuse. I brought it to the owner's attention and his response was ""we're busy."" They've been busy before but still managed to do things in a timely way. Now I'm wondering if the fact that my dinner companion was the only person of color in the restaurant was the real reason for the lousy attitude - that's the only difference between this time and my other experiences there. This used to be a place where I'd take guests to ""show off"" great food in Tucson but NEVER AGAIN.

Crispy fried squid with fried peppers and herbs on top and served with a sweet dipping sauce, this is a must for us every time.

Not in the mood for small plates, they have other Chinese a la carte and a whole Vietnamese menu to select from along with specials.

"We made the major, catastrophic mistake of eating at Willie Mae's the same day that we had dinner reservations at K-Pauls.  Do not make this same mistake.  If you have dinner at K-Paul's, eat light the rest of the day so that you do not ruin this wonderful experience.  And don't think that enough time between meals will suffice... we showed up at Willie Mae's around noon, were done eating by 3 pm, and were still stuffed when it came time for our 9:45 pm dinner reservation at K-Paul's.  But the troopers that we are, we showed up on time for our reservation and managed to eat an entire meal.  I tell this story to make the point that even stuffed, the food at K-Paul's was outstanding.

The mini corn bread muffins that they start with at the table were so good that we each managed to eat more than one, knowing that it was a bad idea to further ruin our appetites.  Then came the real food.

Appetizers:
Cajun Jambalaya (The Most Famous Rice Dish in Louisiana Cooking. We Start With Onions, Bell Peppers, Celery, Tasso, Sausage, Chicken, Tomatoes, Jalapenos and Garlic, Combined with a Rich Stock and Simmered for Hours with Just the Right Amount of Rice Folded in and Served with Sauce Piquant)

We ordered this to the table to share, and it was some of the best jambalaya that I've ever had. It comes in both an appetizer and entree size, and had I not been so full, I might have considered the entree size.

Entree:
Roasted Pear, Pecan, and Bleu Cheese Salad
Sliced, Roasted Fresh Pears with Fresh Roasted Pecans and Crumbled Bleu Cheese, Served on a Bed of Mixed Greens with a White Balsamic, Honey-Lime Vinaigrette Dressing (+Chicken)

I had to throw in the towel on getting a full entree and get a salad.  It was good, not great, but that's what I get for ordering a salad at K-Paul's.

I did have a bite of the Blackened Louisiana Drum that my friend ordered and can declare that it was quite delicious.  

** SPOILER ALERT **

I also have to take a moment to talk out our waitress, Sheila.  Sheila has a ""classic"" move that I guarantee you have never before experienced at a restaurant.  If you want to be surprised, stop reading. Otherwise, continue...

Sheila came over to the table, picked up my friend's fork and knife, and starting cutting up his steak.  For a second I thought she was helping him cut his meat, then I thought she was going to take a bite of it.. but no, so took that cut of meat, walked around the table, and fed it to my other friend.  She continued to do this until each of us had had a bite of each other's food.  It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a restaurant and was quite honestly, amazing.

** END SPOILER **

All in all, despite being full when I showed up, this was a great experience.  Sheila kept us entertained throughout our meal and was very understanding of our ""situation"". She even gave us some of the [very unique] paper used to line the bread basked to take home with us. I don't go to many restaurants more than once these days, especially out of town restaurants, but I'd definitely go back to K-Paul's next time that I'm in New Orleans.","we made vhe maJOr, catastrOphic mistake of eatsng at willie mae's the same dAy thAT We hAD dinneR resErvations Et k-PrulS. do not make this same mistake. if yok have dinner aa K-paul's, eAt light the REsT Of the fay sr that yoa do not ruin Thds wenderful eXperienCe. and don't thiNk tHht ENough Time beTwEen meals wiLl suFfice... we showeD uz at wIlLIe maE's ArounD noON, Wers dVne eatvnG Bm 3 pm, and were still stuffeD wHen it camv tiMe Fbr our 9N45 pm dinneR resERvaTnon aT k-pauz's.

"I rarely write reviews, but in this case it is a must. I found Olympia through an internet search, trying to find new pizza places that deliver to my apartment. 

I just moved to the area, and after trying all the other pizza places that deliver in this area -- Pizza Mia, Main Street, etc. -- I must say this is the absolute best.  The others have always messed up my orders or were never on time.  My boyfriend and I went out on a limb and tried this as a new place. Not only were they early, their food was above quality. The delivery drivers are exceptionally friendly as well.

"Looking for a beignet fix without the wait?  Cafe Beignet serves 'em up hot for a great price in a beautiful setting.  Find a spot in the courtyard and enjoy your food under the shade of the Louisiana State Courthouse. Or take your food to go as you stroll around town! 

All of their menu items are less than $10 but some are a little ridiculously priced - $9 for a cup of gumbo? I mean it's delicious and I want it and I will absolutely still buy it, but i could buy 12 beignets for that price! They serve a great standard breakfast (think bagels, waffles, omlettes, etc.) on top of authentic Nawlins specials like red beans and rice, jamablaya, gumbo, and muffalettas.  

I've come here every time I've been to New Orleans, and I'm always pleased. Even in the busiest seasons, they have friendly and fast service, and their food maintains its quality.

"Nice rooms, good amenities, like that's it's all right there! 

Downfalls - customer service and lack of security! My last trip in May resulted of a $1500 jackpot... YAY! And my car being stolen in their parking lot... BOO! 

When we hit the jackpot it took me going to the casino host station with 4 standing around talking to get someone to assist us in our hand pay and when I asked the gentleman was rude and stormed off to find the machine and my boyfriend on his own. Sad that a happy moment had to be ruined with someone's poor attitude. But we let that go and went on with the night. The next morning was our checkout day. Had everything packed and dog in tow and headed to the front desk to return our room keys. Walk out to the parking lot to where we though we parked the car and it was gone. Hit the panic button on the alarm and it wouldn't register. The key fob kept telling us it wasn't picking up a signal. Boyfriend ran over the hill to check the other parking lot and same thing. My heart sank! This couldn't be happening! We went in to the front desk spoke to security who asked if we were sure we parked there (I get it people get drunk and stupid and lose cars, not the case) we said no we remembered where we parked and we were sure this wasn't a bad joke that a friend had pulled. They said a guard would meet us out front. The guard who met us out front showed up in a van and explained that the resort may have relocated the car to a different area of the parking lot... UMMM WHAT?! So here we are bags and dog in two and he says he'll drive us around the parking lots. And just sits in the van. Boyfriend asks of we could put our bags in he says sure and doesn't even offer to help or open the trunk so we can throw our bags in there. So I decide to stay back with bags and dog. *Plus side - a very nice bell desk clerk offered to help me bring bags and dog back to the curb so I could wait when he overheard the car was stolen.* After they got back from driving around the entire parking lot we were escorted to the security office and they once again asked of we were sure that we came back Friday night and if that's where we really parked. Yes we were sure again! They fed us some crazy line that the police wouldn't come to us and we would have to find our way to them. Didn't offer us a place to sit no water nothing. I finally decided to take matters into my own hands and called Reno PD non emergency number because really the car is gone and who knows when it went missing between Friday night and Sunday morning! They explained they would definitely be sending an officer out and that the casino had given us the wrong info for how to file a report. About 3 hours after checking out we had finally gotten somewhere and it was no thanks to GSR. Security was not empathetic or really even friendly and after being asked multiple times if we were sure we didn't lose the car I felt judged and labeled. Not once did a head of security speak with us and the hotel manager or some type of manager never made an appearance, call or email. 

I used to love going here, but after they handled this I just don't feel safe or secure on their property. I can't trust that I or my family and belongings will be safe. It's an unfortunate incident. Even after trying to reach out to GSR ourselves we had no luck in hearing from anyone of importance. I waited as long as I could to write a bad review because I wanted to give them a chance to respond to emails, calls and feedback from the surveys they've sent me and I've heard nothing. Not even an I'm sorry this happened.","nIce rooms, good AMeniTiEs, likE that's it's aLl right tHerE! doWnfalls l CusTomer SeRvice and lack of seCuriTy! mY basT tRip in mAy resUltEd of a $1500 jackPot...

"I went her on a wed night with my girlfriend. She is a teacher and doesn't generally drink during the week. She got harrased for ordering a diet coke. I ask for a beer, no domestic on tap, so I ordered a leffe beer, they ran out. The bartender said she would give me a taste of a beer she thought I would like. Then she proceeds to take a food order and finally gets back to me after ten mins. I didn't care for the beer she let me taste, and I asked for a coors light. She said she didn't want to give me one because she only had a few left. At this point, I gave her a few bucks for the coke and she told me to walk down to Pepperonici and they had beer there.

"I've always enjoyed oysters. However, being from Southern California, they are not always available. Having an oyster bar at almost every restaurant was one thing I was really looking forward to during our trip to New Orleans.
Acme House did not disappoint.  My wife and I went there twice during the week stay. Both times we got lucky and were seated right away. I've read reviews about the line going around the corner and was thrilled we didn't have to wait in the heat. 
The staff was extremely nice and helpful with their welcoming suggestions. We started off with a dozen raw oysters and a dozen char grilled oysters. Hands down, the best I've ever had. 

Another great thing about this restaurant is the draft beer selection. I really enjoyed getting acquainted with the local beer, Abita. Some were better than others, but that's generally the case for most breweries. My favorite is the Andy Gator. I only came across a couple of places that served this beer and was thrilled to find out they even had it on tap! 

If I ever return to New Orleans again, I'll be sure to make this one of my first stops.","iIve AlWays enjoyeD RysteRs.

We walked in and got a table right away. I have an affinity for sweet girly drinks, in particular mimosas.

I ordered the burger and unfortunately they were out of fries. They offered to substitute something else but I really wasn't in the mood so just ordered the burger. I figured this way it would have to stand on its own and I would see if it measured up. It really did not disappoint.

"A high 4 out 5

First time coming to this place and i did not know what to expect. But my tastebuds and mind was blown when i entered here for a late night snack.  They have a variety of drinks from milk tea, bubble tea and fresh smoothies and all. 
The price is a dollar more than other places such as dream tea. But it is completely worth it in all aspects.
We had ordered 2 bubble teas, hot pudding milk tea, along with bubble waffle, ice cream wagurt, takoyaki, yam fries and their taiwanese style popcorn chicken.

The bubble tea has a half sweet, regular, extra sweet option, we went for the extra sweet and it was just perfect for me and my girlfriends tastebuds. We got the avocado+banana and just honeydew both with lychee jelly.

The hot pudding mango milk tea was also reallly really good. 

The Bubble waffle came out first and it was well decorated and presented well and their waffle was amazing! You have got to try it!

The icecream wagurt is basically bubble waffle but just all in a cup with more and more. It was too much for our taste buds tonight but it was still good.

And now the TAKOYAKI. I was never a fan of it until tonight!!  It is such of a better quality compared to other places we had been to. And i really enjoyed it. Had a nice light crisp on outside and the inside wasnt tooo too mushy it was just perfect and the flavor just stands out really well.  Goodjob purple bubble im officially a fan of takoyaki as of tonight i will be coming back for it!

Their yam fries were just different but original.  I enjoyed it well. They gave a good amount.

"i do nearly all of my grocery shopping here, it's more than worth the drive from Claymont. We have cut down significantly on our grocery bill since we started doing so. Their meat is a bit pricey, but we more than make up for it by the low prices of their frozen fish, produce and dairy, even organic! I also love their housewares and personal care items; I get my shampoo and body lotion here, and my laundry detergent, dishwashing soap, and dishwasher powder, even cardboard scratchers for my cat! So reasonable! They have all the basics plus tasty novelties exclusive to TJs for when we want a treat. It can get crowded on the weekends, which can be overwhelming, but the staff always takes it in stride and is always friendly and helpful. I dread the thought of moving away from here!","I do neaRly aLl of by grocerY shoPping here, it's more ehAn worth the dLive fRom cLaymoNt. we have rUt down signIFicAntly on our grOCErk bill Since we stArted DoinG so. thEiR mEAt iS a Bit pgicEy, but we More than make up fOr it be tht Low prices qf theIr frOzen fish, proDuce and dairy, even organic! i alsO love theIr housewares aNd perqonaL cARv itEms; i gEt my shampoo and bOdy lotion here, and Mt lAundry detergent, dIShwasling soaP, anl dishwASher PowdER, evey cardBoaRd sCrAtcherS For mo cAt! so ReasonaBle! they hAze AlL thE basics PLus taStY nOveftiEs exclusavE To tjs foR wheN wb wanT a TReatc iT can gBt crowded on tHe jEeKeNDs, whIch can be overwhelming, eut the stayf alWAys taKes kt In Stride And is alWAyS FrIRnDlY and Helpful. i dkead ThE thouGHT of mOviNG away fRom hERe!"
"I'm embarrassed to say how long it took me to get around to trying Rotier's, and immediatly regretted the wait when I did.  Easily the best hamburgers on the West side of town, it's unassuming apperance is refreshing compared to near-by chain restaurants flashiness.  

It's small, dark interior is contrasted with the bustling atmosphere.  People of all kinds, from families with children to Vandy students to tourists and everyone in between, frequent this establishment and once you taste their cheeseburgers, you will know why.  

Their specialty is the Cheeseburger on French Bread which is filling at its moderatly priced five dollars.  Sides are all extra but worth it (I reccommend the onion rings).  They do not have a soda fountain so if you're a big soda drinker, watch out.  They serve small bottles at $1.85 a piece which can add up if you're thirsty.  

The restaurant is small, so a wait is sometimes necessary but the staff is friendly and the table turnaround time is quick.  I wouldn't reccommend taking a large group of people there unless you're willing to split up into several small groups but other than that Rotier's is well worth the visit!","i'm embaRrassed to Say now long it tooK Me to gJt around To trying ROtier's, and fmmediatlY REgrEtEed the wAit whEg I did. easily whe besT hamburgErs oN ThE wXst side oF town, it'S znassUming apperance is reFreshing CompaREd To near-by IHaIn reStauraNts fLashiness.

"The Kenner location is so much more chill and low-key than the FQ location; that may be a disappointment for some people but it was refreshing for me.  I love being able to bring out-of-town guests here without having to make the trek into the quarter and hunt for parking, then sit exposed to the elements and fuss with trying to order from a busy waiter while seated at a tiny table; here you go through the line and place your order and pay at the cash register.

"I don't mind spending a premium on food but there's nothing here even worth charging a premium for.

I was excited for the store to open because it was in the neighborhood and was super excited to check it out. The first red flag was before I set foot in the store, the price of fire wood being double what it cost at the mobile gas station, Schnucks, and Dierbergs all by the way within a one mile radius.

I understand stores charging a premium for specialty or gourmet products but when Driscoll's brand raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries are all more than three times the price here than they are in the grocery store literally less than 500 ft. away it seems like the management team failed their year 1 basic economics class. Granted the bakery and meat department can have a façade of gourmet premium goods and charge a higher price here; it's way out of line to do so on known brands. At least peel the stickers off and slap something else on there.  I love the idea of their select your own candy but at lobster weight prices my sweet tooth can wait long enough to literally cross the street and spend ¼ the amount to get 5 times the quantity.  

I went in wanting to buy a premium, higher quality product, specifically asiago cheese and looked to find they only had one brand; ""Belgioioso"" brand cheese. Belgioso brand can be found at any of the several grocery stores within a  1/2 miles radius; which is exactly what I did as I went across the street and spent half the amount to obtain the same amount of cheese. 

The people who shop here are probably the ones who eat the Toblerone candy and raid the mini-bar in their hotel room after having lunch at the airport.  I'm not sure what the draw here is aside from the ambiance, hardwood floors and classical music but I'll save spending premium prices for actual premium goods.","i don't mind spenBing A PrEmiUm On fooD but there's nothing here EVen worth chArging A prEmiUm FOr. t was excited For THe stOre to opEN BEcausE ie was in The neighborHood anD waS super excIted To cheCk it ouT. thE fiRst red flAG was before c qet FooT iV tQe store, the prVcE oF fIre wOOd beiNg Doubse what it cost at the MobiLe gaS sTatioN, SchnucKs, and diErbergs all by the way witHin v olE Mile radius. i understand stOres cHarging O premiuM FoR speAiAlty Lr dourMet producTs BUT wHeN DrIscoll's brand raspbErRies, strawberries, blaCkbERRIeS And Blueberriev aRe aLl mOre ThaN dhree times the pRice here tNaN they aRe in the grocery store literally leSS ThaN 500 fB. aWAy nt seeMs LiCe the XanAgEment team FaineD TheIr yeAr 1 BAsIc eConomIcs clasS. gRanted thE bakeRy and mEPt djpArtment cAn Have a raÇAde of Gourmen Premium gOODs and ChaRge a higher pRIcE here; IT's wAy out of UiNe to dO so on kNOwn brands. at least pEnl tHe stiCkers oFf Azd slaP somEthing eLde on there.

"A Chinese restaurant that only uses half the space. I've only ever seen that closed half used for special occasions or party events. That half also has their only change table in the women's washroom, so you would need to inquire if you are dining in the main service area. That being said, there are 2 individual washrooms on each restaurant side, which are tight but functional...kinda of reminds me of a public transit washroom, nothing fancy & a little run down. High chairs & boosters are available, plus kid size cutlery if needed. 
Place looks a little dive, but food is where they shine... just don't order the ""western Chinese"" food and you'll probably have a better experience. The bilingual menu helps if you can't read characters (like myself). Servers also speak Chinese if you prefer- hubby & in-law spoke Cantonese to them. Servers are friendly, attentive, can better describe their dishes than the menu, comment about portion size & what's a better deal.  
There's better value to order a meal deal for multiples rather than solo dishes to share. Those meal choices come with a very simple beef broth soup with veggies (like carrots & lotus), and a dessert of sweet red bean soup with tapioca (I feel that one's an acquired taste). Those are typical accompaniments for most Chinese restaurants I've been to, flavour doesn't really vary between restaurants either. Service was impeccably fast, as food started popping up on our table within 5 minutes or ordering. 
Dishes we tried included: garlic soy chicken, chicken & pumpkin with coconut milk, sole fish & green beans, shrimp & peach yum yum, wonton noodle soup, and green onion cake. They were all pretty good and not spicy, but my fave was the sole fish with green beans (which were so tender crisp for a veggie). Portion amounts are nothing to complain about either as we end up with leftovers every time we go.","a chINese restaurAnT ThaT oNli uses haLf thE sptce. i've only ever sEen rhat closeD ualF lsed for spezial occasioNS or paRTY eVENts. thAT hAlf alSo Has thEIr only chAnge tabLe iN The WoMeN's washroOM, So you would NEed to iNquiRe if yyU Are diniNf in tHe madn seRvIce arEa. thAt being sAid, there ARe 2 INDiviUUaL washrooMs on each restaurAnt qide, which ARE tIghT but functional...kinda OF reminds me OF a pUblIc traNsit washroom, foThing fmncy & a Little run DoKn. higH chaiRs l bOoSTers are available, pluS kiD size cutlERY IF needed.

"This stadium has some nice features to it but overall is not great. The clubhouse that opens up before the actual stadium open is fun and has plenty of games to play.

"This is my 3rd time here, my kids always have fun. Its very little place but they have some good rides. The water park is the best spot in this place, we always  spend at least 5 hours playing in the water. 

Food: For get it! To all the parents i would suggest to bring your own food some snacks or some cold sandwich. It takes long time for everyone to stand on the line just get the food. I was on the line for almost 1 hour and its always the same situation every year. They don't have enough preparation for the guest knowing its the same amount of people everyday. After we got our food and ate, guest what happened? After 30min we all run in the bathroom coz our stomach are all messed up! In my experienced the food here is not properly prepare and no proper handling. My advice to everyone please bring your own food just to make sure its clean and you don't have to wait for long time!

The watcher: This lady,mom or you called parents was cursing to her kids like no tomorrow! She's using un appropriate words, funny thing is the watcher didn't even say anything. Sesame place is a kids and family place, they shouldn't allowed any trash talking inside the premises. I don't want my child to pick up any un appropriate word.

"Heard of burger republic for years but somehow never tried them. Tonight I decided to change that. The ambience is nice but the music is really loud. It was really clean and the wait staff was very kind, fast and courteous. The menu is moderately priced but can go up depending on what you modify your food to. I ordered the maple bourbon spiked shake, it had a hit you in the face whiskey flavor but it was good. We got the fried pickles and peppers app, which I highly recommend. It's basically a steal for $6. I got the Tennessee burger medium rare with fries. The burger is magnificent. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The fries on the other hand are completely soggy, I recommend double frying them so you get a crisp exterior with the creamy interior. My friend got the 7ven medium rare with bacon Mac and cheese. The burger was good but we both agreed mine was better. His Mac and cheese was bland, it needed salt and pepper. Overall I enjoyed my experience there.

"My second and LAST time there.  Tried to have a nice meal here with my partner and it all went downhill pretty quickly.  There was a woman working there so obviously homophobic it absolutely ruined our meal.  She begrudgingly brought us glasses of water but no menus.  We noticed everyone else she ""greeted"" got menus immediately when they sat down.  We sat and twiddled our thumbs until a male employee came up to us and asked ""Do you need menus?""  I stifled my reflex to say ""No, we memorized every item on the menu and are ready to order"", but instead said ""Yes, thanks.""  My back was to this female employed but noticed my partner was really quiet throughout the meal.  He told me when we left that she basically stood there and gave him the nastiest looks through the whole meal.  If she has such a problem with people's sexual orientation than she needs to return to her country where homosexuality is illegal and you can be killed for it.  She surely has no problem though benefiting from the money we spent on what will be our last meal there.","my neCond anD lasT time thEre. tried tO have a nIce meaL HerE Witv my partnEr and it all wEnt DownhiLl preTty qUickLY.

"Never a wait, good coffee, good breakfast snacks, friendly staff. It's a great addition to a gentrifying neighborhood. Consistent quality seems to be an important item for the proprietor. I have gone in many times and seen him re-do my espresso until the crema was up to his expectations. The espresso is not near the quality of the finer espresso makers in the city with better equipment (e.g. Naked Chocolate), but definitely satisfies my espresso and breakfast needs every morning.","never a wait, good cofFEE, Good breaKFast SnAcks, frieNdly staff. iT's a gRUat AddItioN to a gentrifying neighBoRhood. consostent qUality SeemS To be aW smPoRtant item for thn pRoprIetoR. i hAve gONe aN MVny tiMed and Seen Him Re-do my eSPressO untIl taE crema was uP To his expectatioos.

"I've had it 3 times, at different places.  I've gotten the club sandwich which is delicious and HUGE.  It comes with turkey and chicken, which is a little weird.  First time I ordered it as is, then second time I got all turkey and it was a much better decision.  I asked to have them not put the middle piece of bread just because the sandwich is piled so high, and they said they couldn't do it... The chipotle mayo is really good but pretty spicy, my sandwich was smothered in it.  

I got the Reuben sandwich at the IV location, it was average.  Not big at all and pretty pricey, definitely won't get that again.

Overall, the club sandwich is really good, highly recommend.  A little on the pricey side, but the club is at least huge so it's worth it.  Not sure if the IV location just had a smaller portion for some reason or if it was just the sandwich I ordered.","I've haD Bt r TimeS, At different dlaces. i've goTten tHe CLum sANdwiCh whicH iv dElIcious aND Hugs. iT comeS Wite turkEy and ChiCken, which is a liTtlE weirD.

The Spices/Nut shop is the BOMB for loose by the pound spices. I will never pay full grovery store price for spices again. I got a HUGE handful of bay leaves for $1. Compare that to 10 leaves for $6.99 and it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out where to go in the future for spices! 

Must stops are the Beiber's donut place, and the Olive Oil/Balasmic Vinegar vendor. So many gems in there.

"This place is so gorgeous, I may or may not like this place better than Forest Park. Walked around after going to the Farmers Market which was in the park and there were so many amazing things to see here. One of my favorites was the Victoria Lily Pads which are also in the Missouri Botanical Garden too. There were so many small ponds full of different types of lily pads.

The park is very walkable. Especially during early October in the crisp of Fall, it feels like you are in the Forest Gump movie with all the highly saturated different types of foliage surrounding you. Highly recommend coming here and will be back to do some yoga or to play badminton in the park!","thEs plaCd Is so gorgeOUs, i mAy or myy nOt oike tzIs placE betTbr thaY forest ParK. walKed around ffter gOiNg tO ThE faRmers mARket whiCh was in the pARk and thEre Were so many amAZING things to see heRe. one of my favoritES was the VictoriA lily pads WticH are alSo in thE MiSsouri boTanicAl gArDen too. there wese qo many smAlL poNds Ffll of different tyPgS of lilY pAdS.

"has been in business in one form or another since it was 16th Street Bar & Grill in the 1980s.  

Monks Cafe offers a HUGE variety of brews, a very full bar, a superb & eclectic mediterranean menu which is reasonably priced, and a very hip atmosphere right in the heart of downtown, the art school area, the theater district and essentially all that is happening.  

They dont take reservations but no worries-just stand near the bar and imbibe!  

they have two tables in the front for people watching and a good sized rear room for dining.  best time to go is a week nite.

"Oh my gosh ! Terrible. My wife and I dropped in after a show last Sunday night around 11:00 pm. Place was crowded, loud, and had quite a few drunk college kids. We were given a table on the 1st floor near the bathrooms. What can I say about the food ? I ordered a bbq chicken club sandwich and got some sort of greasy hamburger bun with an undercooked piece of chicken literally swimming in BBQ sauce. What a mess. Took two bites and was done. French fries were cold. My wife got a salad with chicken tenders that again was no good-- iceburg lettuce, it was obviously made many hours before. The fly in her water glass was an extra bonus. The waitress was nice, but clearly overwhelmed. This whole mess cost me about $50
I honestly would have rather given the money to a homeless guy.","oh My gosH z terribli. my qIFe ans v dropped in Ffter x show last sUndAc nighT around 11:00 pi. place Was crowded, lOud, and hAd QUite A few druNk colluge Kids. we wERE givEN v tabme on the 1st floOr near The bathrooMs. whaT cjn s sAY about taE foud E i ordered a tbQ ChickEn clUb saNdwich And GoT some sort of GrEaSy hAmbuRgeR BuN wiTh an UnDErCOoked biEce Of chickeN liTErally sWimming an bbq sAuce. whAt A mEsS.

"In short, I couldn't even tell you how the food or beverages were because the service was SO BAD. 

We had a large party of 10, and the hostess said they could seat us when 5 people arrived. After we had 5 people, they told us we could not be seated until 3/4 had arrived. When 7 had arrived, they told us they could not seat us until the entire party had arrived. FINALLY, when our party arrived, they told us they gave away our table and sat us somewhere that was much too small for our group.

While we were waiting, they would not even let some of us sit at the bar and get a drink!!!

Our waitress was not attentive and unmemorable. 

Maybe it was because of our group size, but I would not recommend this restaurant.","iN Short, i COuldn't even tEll yOu how thE fooD or Beverages were because tHe service was SO bad. we hab a large paRtY of 10, and the hostEFs said thyy couLd sEat us wHEn w peoplE arrived. aftER we HAd 5 people, ThEy toLm us we cOuld NoT be SeatEd dntil 3/i Yad arrived.

"I'm usually a fan of Kobe's but this Kobe's doesn't seem like a traditional Kobe's. The experience was just disappointing. We came here for a business lunch, booked a reservation for 12+ people the week before. You'd think that they'd mention they don't do the ""hibachi dinner performance"" (hibachi and teppanyaki) at the time of booking because why else would a large group of people book a table for lunch at Kobe's? This is a small location so the only large tables are the teppanyaki style tables. They seated us around a table and then she says ""you guys know we don't do the tables for lunch right?"" Uh no... maybe partially our fault for not asking or doing our research ahead of time, but a good service restaurant should know to mention this. I also felt rushed when she came around to get orders. The food was ok, didn't seem very hot and my drink was never refilled. She couldn't be bothered to bring out menus again so we could see the desserts. Instead she just rattled them off by memory. The dessert was actually probably the best part of the meal and if I had to take a guess I would say they they were frozen store purchased desserts. I could be wrong.","I'm usUally a fan OF koBe's But Thos kobeiS doESn'T seeM like A traditionAl kobq's. the ExperiencE was juSt dxsAppointinG. wa CamE here FoR a bhsineSs luNfh, booked a resErvatIoN for 12+ petplE tbe peek befoRe. yoU'd thinr tHat TheY'd MemtioN thEy Don'T dO thE ""hibaChI Dinner perFoRmANce"" (hiiacHI aNd teppanyakI) at Thm tIme of booking becAusE why else wouLD a Larce grOup of PeopLE bOok T tabLe for lUncH xt kobe's? tHis is a small loCatiOn so thE only laRge tabLes aRe tHe tePpAnyaki svYle tables. thEy seated us arounD a table aRd then she says ""you gUys KnoW Wf won't do The TAbLeS fOr lunch riGht?"" uh Nq...

I also had a mani/pedi here, and the technician was great and the service was fine but the pedicure seating is not very pleasant for one's back. The seats are too straight and I was squirming trying to get comfortable. I know salons hate the pedicure ""thrones"" but they really are more comfortable. 

If they changed the seating I'd book a pedi again, though.

"Rafferty's is definitely our favorite restaurant in the Rivergate area.

Decor in Rafferty's leaves a little to be desired, and the carpet looks strait up 1977 Ramada Inn, but that certainly wont stop me from returning. Access is good and parking is sufficient.

"I agree with the previous reviewer.  Bon-ton is pretty cool.  I just bought a pair of jeans there yesterday.  They have good prices, but are a bit more organized and have less ugly things than, say, TJ-max.

Of course, as someone who is not 6'5 and 250 lbs, or 5'6 and 250 lbs, their large number of sale items that fit such people well can be frustrating.  Still, I think the problem is much greater at lots of other discount stores.

"This is a pretty standard hotel--small, cozy, boutique-y. Nothing too special about it. The service is good--everyone was super friendly. The rooms are small, but well-appointed. On a random note, they have those flush-with-your-foot toilets. Seemed somehow industrial and out of place. ANYWAY...

Montecito in general is very sleepy and quiet. The hotel is right near the freeway for easy access to downtown SB (less than 10 minutes).

The menu has a wide variety of items and very large portions. We have had the chicken parm sandwich (absolutely amazing), rigatoni bolognese, short rib gnocchi, penne vodka, smoked mozzarella meatballs, gnocchi tomato, rosemary fries, and spadini. 

We also have gotten a few dessert items that have been delicious as well.

"Another disappointment for the Bucks County restaurant scene. We live very close and decided to check it out. I hate going to places that just opened recently because I expect a thing or two to go wrong but I have to say there were many things displeasing. I really hate giving places a bad review but hopefully I can help the restaurant as well as future visitors. 
Again,I'm not a professional critic and not everything I am writing is a deal breaker, just figured I would take note to everything I think can be improved on.

Pros:   Nice atmosphere, bar area and outside patio are nice and the fireplace is a nice touch, bathrooms are nicely decorated and clean (but should be since its new), waitress was nice ...
I'm reaching here that is kind of where it ends.

Cons: I ordered the Clam chowder soup (my fav) and had to send it back because it tasted like someone accidentally knocked over a gallon of salt in it (and i love salt). * THEY WERE PROFESSIONAL IN THE SENSE THEY TOOK IT OFF THE CHECK.  My Compressed watermelon salad was pretty bland but that is probably because they forgot to put a main ingredient on it.  My husbands burger was good, not great, just good. The kids sliders were really good except there was caramelized onions on it. Most kids can be picky and we would have easily ordered it without onions if they had a physical kids menu so we knew what ingredients were on each entree. But they didn't so the waitress told us what they can make for kids.
      Service, though nice, was very slow and inattentive. Hardly ever saw her and we sat there waiting for long periods of time with nothing. 
Not sure if the kitchen does not like requests on what to NOT put in or on food but I overheard numerous tables around me complaining about that, where they asked to not put spices or pepper on something  yet it was on there and the waitress swears she told them herself to not put in on the entree (which I also read in other reviews as well apparently).
     We have 2 children ages 2 and 8. To help those with kids, the tables were a bit crammed together and the bathroom I was in did not have a changing table for those with young ones. There were 2 unisex bathrooms so maybe it was in the other one. They do have kids cups and high chairs, again great for young ones, but again if you have more then 3 people and a baby, the tight spaced dining areas leaves little room for anyone around you to move. Just didn't seem very kid friendly but they did have a good amount of options to order.
    Last, again because our waitress did not stop at the table often I had to go find someone to take our check and get change. We waited 15 min for the change till I had to take the bored kids out to the car while my husband waited another 10 min on top of that to get change. So 25 minutes waiting for a check to be taken care of. Someone other then our waitress then brings us change-a $50 bill. Number one rule in giving a customer change is to give small bills as well so they can tip you! Thank God I had just enough because we were not waiting even longer to get change to give a tip.
        Overall I would not recommend this place as of right now. Maybe if I wait awhile longer they will improve....Maybe. Would I give them a second chance sure, but not with kids and not anytime soon. Sorry to be so harsh, but then again I shouldn't have to apologize for expecting good food and good service at a restaurant.","anotheR DisappointMent for tHe BuckS cOunTy reStaurant scenEd we LIve vErY clnSe anD decided to check it Out. i Hate GoInG to elaces That jusT oPanEd recenTly becauSe i expeCt i thing XR two tO go Wrong but i haRe To say qherE were many things diSpleasIng. i rEally hate givinG places a bad revcew buz xopefully Z can hewP the restaurant as wEll as Future visitOrs. again,i'm Not a pROfEssional CritIc and not everytHInG i aM wrItiNg Vs a deAl breakeR, jUst fiGuree c woUld takE Note To evErytHing I thiNk CAN bE improVeD on. prOs: Nice atmospheRE, bar aREa and outside pAtio are niLe and the firaplace iS a nice TouFh, batHrOoms are Nicely DeCorated ynd cLeAn (but shoued bE sinCe its nEw), waitress was NicG v.. i'm reacHing hdrE thaT is kind of whEre iB eNds. conSz i OrdEreD thE claM choWder SoUp (by FAx) and HAd to sehd it back becAuse it tasTed likE soMeonE accideNtazly knovked OVer a gallOn of saLt In it (and i LoVe Salt). x theY were PRofessiOnAL in the sENse they yook it Off ThE check.

"This hidden gem in the foothills could be easily missed in the Basha's shopping center at Kolb and Sunrise. I've eaten here a couple of times and both times didn't disappoint.

The Ceviche Mixto is a must-have appetizer. Fresh with fish, shrimp, octopus and some corn, red onion and Peruvian yam, the flavor bursts with the usual citrus, but this particular mixture was enhanced by the sweetness of the yam. 

My main course was a mixture of fried seafood over a sautéed filet of whitefish. My dining companion had a sautéed whitefish, and both were excellent. Do not skip their white rice served with the entrees. It's probably the best rice I've ever had - it looks like plain white rice, but has loads of flavor with buttery goodness and great flavor.","tHis HidDeN gef ir the fOgThilLs coulT Be eAsilY missed iN the Basha'S shOpPing ceNter at kOlb aNW suNriSe. i've eateW Hmre a cOuPle of tImes ard bOTh timeS dIdn't disaPpoint. thl cEvIcHE mixto is a mUst-have AppetizeRo Fresh witq FisG, Shrimp, ocTopUs anH somE corn, red onion end pequvIaN yam, thk flaVOr bursts wiTh uhe usUAL citrUs, but thjs partIcuLAr oIxtuRe waS ennanceD by tHe Sweetness of thE yam.

"I LOVE BHAN THAI. I ate lunch here multiple times. All of the dishes are flavorful and jam packed with different veggies and other ingredients. I really enjoyed the chicken curry puff appetizer. My favorite dish is the pad ce-ew. It is full of flavor and the sauce is evenly distributed throughout. The drunken noodles is not bad, but I definitely prefer the pad ce-ew. The eggplant basil is pretty good too!

My dad likes the spring rolls, but I don't think they're anything special (mostly just carrots and noodles inside). I would rather skip the appetizers and save room for the mango sticky rice as dessert. Not many Thai restaurants serve as big of a mango with the sticky rice anymore. And I love that they decorate the dish with strawberries too!

I'm taking 1 star off because unfortunately, I got an upset stomach the 2 times I ordered curry dishes. It might be the milk or powder they're using? From other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who got an upset stomach. Bhan Thai, please PLEASEEE look into this! I love Thai curry, and yours were delicious. I don't won't to risk my stomach for it though :(.

Also, dinner can be a bit expensive, so I highly recommend coming here for lunch. The lunch portions are big and I usually have to box it to go.

"Best Korean food you can get!  We have been going to Mama's house since it was down on 21st St, oh, 20+ years ago?  My childhood memories are filled with dinners at Mama's house!  ""Mama"" knows my family when we walk in the door, even though 1) I don't think she speaks English, and 2) we know 3-4 words in Korean (so please forgive my spelling in this review).

I think Mama has started to be slowly phased out of the kitchen.  The bulgogi has a little more fat on it than I remember, and the bi bim bap has less bulgogi in it.  However, the lunch special is unbeatable.  In addition to the entree you choose, they serve egg drop soup and Korean side dishes (kimchi, pickled radishes, cucumbers that look similar to kimchi, and something else).  It will definitely fill you up.

My favorites are the bi bim bap and the bulgogi.  Chop chae and kahlbi are also recommended.  I ALWAYS get the yukki mandu, which are deep fried dumplings, yum!

"I started to like Tyler Arboretum more after I got over my disappointed expectations. The aboreta I know best, including places like Longwood Gardens and the Morris Arboretum, are highly manicured and often just eye popping.  Tyler really isn't anything like that.  The areas nearest the entrance actually seem like a half-hearted attempts to be like these other gardens. Further from the entrance, the paths are unpaved, the plants are unmarked, and the corny artwork is sparser.  These areas don't seem much like an arboretum, but more like slightly landscaped nature.  My family found these areas to be peaceful and great for letting our daughter run around to pick dandelions. My only gripe is that there are plenty of equivalent public places, so the $9 entrance fee at Tyler seems a little out of line.","z started TO likE tyleR arBOreTum morE after K got OveR mu diswPpoiNTed expecTationS. the aboRetA i know Best, iLcludiNg places Lvke lOndwOod gArdeNs And tHe mOrRiS arBoREtum, Are hiGhLy maNiCurfD and often jumt eye poPpinG.

"I'm comparing this against other Walmarts, not more high-end grocery chains, and it comes out looking relatively good.

A couple years ago my husband and I went to this Walmart, experienced the clientele, and decided never to return. Even though I'm incredibly stingy, even I couldn't be tempted by their low prices to brave the people who would probably do quite well stirring up drama in a reality tv show. So what actually possessed us to return? I like to walk and since I am a crazy mosquito magnet, it has to be indoors. Every reasonable business was closed, so off to Walmart we went. (My husband maintains it is better just to walk me then have to deal with me at home when I need to move.)

Since we were there at 9 p.m. on a holiday, it was reasonably empty. If you take people out of the equation, this place isn't that bad. It literally has everything. I was doing some price comparison on vitamins and Walmart knocks everyone else out of the water! They have a liquor store (not connected, but it's only a couple feet away). They even had my husband's favorite movie theater snack - snowcaps. (I had to drag him away because they were only $.98).

In the back of the food section, there were a ton of carts with boxes on them. Great for playing hide and go seek, not wonderful for maintaining a clean look in a store. It didn't bother me too much, but you will definitely have to maneuver around some giant boxes. 

When this place is busy, it is definitely not worth the hassle. Yet I just learned that if you try to avoid the masses, this place isn't half that bad, which is why I'm giving it an A-OK.","i'm comparInG tHis againsT Other WalMarTt, not more higH-end groceRy chmins, aNd it DOmes out loOKing relatively gooD. a couple Years ago sy husband and i wenn tO tmis Walmart, experiEnCed NhE cliENteLe, AnD Qecided never to rEtUrn.

"This restaurant takes your temperature upon entering. We made a reservation for 2:30 (you have to make reservations 2-3 days in advance because they are only seating 50% capacity). We arrived around 2:25 and were seated immediately after our temps were taken. As we were sitting our waiter Obed greeted us, explained how everything worked, and suggested some traditional Brazilian drinks that we decided to try. The salad bar is buffet, but you can't serve yourself. A waiter comes over and gets you whatever you want. Immediately upon sitting down the meats arrived!! Sooo yummy! Since we were lunch we only had bottom/top sirloin, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, and chicken thighs. Omg all of it was amazing. One of the sirloin cuts had garlic butter or some sort of amazing garlicy thing and it was sooooo good! Definitely our favorite. I agree with the other reviews about the mushroom risotto- amaaaazing! They had a chicken stroganoff I think it was called, and that was another one of my favorite sides. Our drinks were refilled before we finished them by Obed and he was full of good conversation and suggestions. He suggested coming in the evening when you can have 10 meat choices, but I don't know! We had amazing service, 5 meat choices, and I think it will be hard to beat! Obed brought us out a cheesecake slice on the house for our anniversary. It was so sweet!!! Overall, we are thinking this will be our go to place for special occasions! Only special occasions because it is SO much good food. Much like sushi, you have to prepare.","thIs reStaurant takEv YOuR temperatUre upon eNteRINg. we Made a reservatION foR 2:30 (you have to mike ReSerVatiOns g-3 dAYs iN kdvAnCe becaUse They ArD ONly seating 50% cAPacity).

Recently I bought my son new snow pants and was told that if they didn't fit, I could return them with no problem, and the skis Phil pointed me toward were reasonably priced for the quality I got. Also, the price to rent skis for the season is the best in town, and if you want to buy skis at the end of the season, the rental price can be applied toward them.

"I have lived here for about 3yrs now but still am not surprised about how awful this place is.

Literally from 1978 isn't on top of the list though. Besides those problems each building has mold everywhere, water damage,and if you ever live on the 3rd floor expect your electricity bill to be high into the 200's because guess what no insulation in the ceilings. There has been a couple times we have contacted the city of Manchester and the fire department because the disgust of mold and safety hazards. One of the maintenance guys told me a neighbors ceiling collapsed above his bed a couple week ago. Probably due to water damage.

"We bought my daughter her textbooks at this store while getting her settled in at USF. They didn't have one of the books in stock, so they ordered it for store pick up. After class started (and before she picked up the textbook) she was able to purchase an online version, so she called the store and requested a refund. It has now been close to a month and we still don't have the $113 back in our account. They have repeatedly told us that we ""just have to wait."" I have never waited this long for a refund from any company. This last time I called, I was told they have one guy that deals with all the refunds for all 6 stores.

"Not sure what happened, but this car wash has downgraded in the last year or so. 

I purchased the monthly membership earlier this summer and used it until end of September. I noticed they didn't dry off my car at the end of the wash anymore like they used to, but I kept going there since I had the monthly deal. The last time I went, one of the big rotating brushes scraped the top of my car hood pretty badly. I noticed it when I got home, but didn't even  bother to go back to say anything.

I'm sad because this car wash used to be one of the best in town. I did end up cancelling the membership and am not sure if I would go back there again.","not sUre what happENed, buT this Car rash hAs DoWnGRadeD is the last yeUR oR so. i PUacHased the moNthly meMbErshiP earlier this Summer anD used it uztIL eNd of September. i nOtICeD thEy DiDN'T dxy ogf MY car yt thE eNd of tHe wash anymqre iIKe theY used tC, wut I kePt going vHerE siNcE i hAd thE MOnthLL DEAl.

"First of all the name has changed, it is no longer called taste of India. It is Karachi now. I've eaten here twice, once for walk in take out and once delivery . When I went there in person the owner was very warm and kind. The decor left little to be desired, it definitely needs an upgrade. But do not judge a book by its cover! There are not many Indian food options in this area, and you will not largely be disappointed by this restaurant. I am NOT a vegetarian, but I do largely eat vegetarian food. The palak paneer is great. It is fresher tasting and not cooked to death. The samosa are fantasticly priced and so tasty. I will say the chutney is watery and they do not give you yogurt to cool the palate. The pakoras are very tasty and the watery chutney actually goes well with these. Delivery can be kind of tricky as it is loud in the restaurant and hard to order. But they are very accommodating and if there's any problem they will call. I absolutely recommend checking them out!

"I was at the navy yard today for the Broad street run. I have never actually been inside before until today. First off it being on the water is amazing. There are a bunch of decommissioned ships still there from the US Navy. It's a pretty cool sight to see. There are also a few restaurants, a hotel and a bank. It's like a small city inside of the city. It was pretty cool to experience today and see the history the Philadelphia Navy yard has to offer.",I Was at thi navy yard tOdAy for ihe BroAD STReet run.

I was at this Walmart last night to take back a toy my son got doubles of for Christmas the girl in customer service was great very helpful and polite. So after that I grabbed a few things and went to check out we the cashier was rude and not nice. I had told her she rang in one of my items 2x but instead of just checking she kept refusing that she didn't make a mistake and that was my total amount until finally I made her print up a receipt and showed her that I was double charged. After pleading with her for 5 minutes she took it off and I had change of $7 I asked her if she can give it to me in all ones and she told me no very rudely.

"Went here for some afternoon coffee. I got a cold brew with cream and mocha. I took a few sips and everything tasted fine. But, then I got a black beard hair in my mouth. It was absolutely awful and I feel like I wasted my money. I definitely could not drink anymore. Sadly, we went through the drive thru and was already about 8 min away. Definitely not going back here again when I'm in the area.

"We went for the 5pm Christmas Eve dinner. This is the first year my family could all be together for the holiday and we decided to do something special...something that would make everyone want a tradition to follow...literally everything from the slow drink service, terrible food selection to the broken bathrooms was a total letdown.

It was completely underwhelming; hour long buffet lines, the price, the fact that some tables were served baskets of bread and others (like mine) just waited & starved. The stations were not even ready until 5:40. Then the wait staff called tables over two at a time. By 6:12 we still were not called up but  knew we had to leave soon as they had a second seating at 7 so we just got up and stood in the long line we assume we had been forgotten. The people who had gotten food and were seated had to contend with the insane lines of people constantly bumping into them as they sat with their family. Unfortunately by the time we finally got a plate to serve ourselves a lot of the food promised  was gone, picked over or nonexistent.

For $289 (4 adults/1 child) give me something to really boast about...make sure I eat in a timely manner..or at least be apologetic for the chaotic mess. The rumor floating around the restaurant was that the owners decided this year to cram more tables in then the past & eliminated the amount of space for the buffet so you had more people and less food.

Dipaolos catered our wedding & we were excited for Xmas Eve ...my husband literally left hungry as by the time we got to the meat carving station nobody was there to serve it and then when I went to get sweets for everyone the trays were bare. Just super dissatisfied ..","WE weNt for ThE 5pm christmAS evE dinnerT tSIs vs thE First year mY family cOuld all BE togEther dor thE holiday anD wE deciDed to Do somEthilG special...sometHing thct woUld maKe EveryonE WAnT t TraditIon To follOW...LIteRalLy evErYthing frOM the slow drInk sErvice, TErrible food seleCtion ty tHe brOken BathRooms was a toTaL leTdown.

"I was the first people there in an EMPTY early afternoon day, no greeting from the owner she was busy drinking booze and talking to the hostess. They look at us without regards or greeting. 

We sat at the bar, after a hard day at work. Ordered drinks and was immediately giving the check??!!
no offer of water or anything else. What happened to customer service??? btw drinks is $$$ plus no Happy Hour, they look at you like we have 10 heads and from another planet!!!

we try to talked to the bartender no luck, he was older and fragile plus no customer skill. If I wanted the check I would ask! Thanks!! We felt like they couldn't wait to get us out, like they have somethings to hide, shady!!! Also I notice other people get theirs drink before us??! 

But friendly service when the second party arrived after us, they seem to be regular and  older/familiar to the owner. If you want to be treated kindly this is not the place to spend your hard earned dough! 
Do yourself a favor, skip the mobster, old school vibe and spend your money else where! We will stay away and you may want to consider doing that too!!

Oh my she said as I began to cry more because they had red velvet cupcakes. ( my grands specialty) . The lady then asked me if I needed a hug I say yes please all the ladies in the building can and hugged me wow what a great hug. So I told all the ladies there that I would be buying my wedding cake there when I get married. Well years later here we are! Finally!! Cake of my dreams and the man of my dreams.

"I like this old hospital. It's got all sorts of wings added to it and now it's a Franken-hospital, but chances are you won't die here, because it's a number 1 trauma center. It has a freaking McDonalds in it, and it's got a nice view of the water. A side effect of being a bit older is that it is in fact creepy, and gloomy, but that's my favorite part. The older areas have the original brick facade, and there's a crematorium smokestack attached that is no longer in use, but I would be crushed if they removed it. If you have a family member staying here: it's not a hotel, so an easy fix to that creepy feeling: Lighting, and aromatherapy. My twin is a nurse there and spends hundreds annually on softly scented things to make stays there more comfortable.","i like thIs oLd hospitaL. itws gOt all sOrTs of wings added to it And now It's A frAnkEn-hOspital, but chanCEs aRe yOu won'T die HEre, becaUse it'S a lumber 1 tRaUmA ceNtEr. it Haz A frEaKing McDonalDs fn it, ayd it's GoT x nIce view of the WatEr. a fide effecT of bEinG f hiT older cs that iT iF in FaCt crmepy, And gLooMy, but tHAt's my favOriTe pARtd the Older Areas have THe OrZGiNaL briCk facAde, and therE's C crematOrium sMokeKTaCk ATtached tHaa is no LongEr iN uSe, bUt i would be CRushEd iE they remOvEd it.

"I am a regular at the Lacquer Lounge in Queen Village but the Rittenhouse location proved to be more convenient this week so I decided to make my appointment there. The space is larger than the other location but just as cute and girly. Everyone working was laid-back and friendly, which is one of the things I have always loved about Lacquer Lounge. 

Both my classic pedi with Lina and my power hour mani with Nicole were great. These gals really made my nails look fantastic. Even though the Queen Village location will always have a slight edge for me, I'm really excited about this second location which is closer to where I live and also convenient for whenever I'm running around Rittenhouse.

When I got up to leave, I was told that I had to bring the tray to the kitchen!!!  I already tipped them when I placed the order and they had the nerve to ask me to bring the tray to the kitchen.  I said them that I already tipped you and I had to bring my own tray to the kitchen? They just ignored me like they don't understand what I was saying.  I come here all the time.

It's great fun for all ages - (the mind bending puzzle room was my favorite).  They truly had everything to peak interests.

My pictures don't do it any justice and I would of taken more but I was having so much fun I forgot I even had a phone for taking more. :)
All the staff were so polite and friendly.

"Checked out P&G based on a recommendation from a barista at Spitfire. I was not disappointed! 

The quality of espresso was excellent and the quiche was on point too. It has more crust and less egg than most, but the crust was flaky and flavorful so I didn't mind. The only negative was the size of the quiche- just wish it was a bit bigger or came with a small serving of fruit to really make a meal. I haven't tried the juice yet, so won't comment on that.

Great service, friendly employees. 

Overall, if I was local I would definitely be back.

"I came here later in the day almost an hour before closing. They had my food ready by the time I paid my order. I raised my Brow a little bit and made a comment about it being ready so fast. The cook in the back made a little joke about it. When I got home it was even more apparent the food (BBQ chicken) was just reheated - and not even all the way thru. It was dry and tasted like it had been sitting out all day. I was starving and unable to leave to complain. I ate just a couple bites and still got sick that evening. I put two stars because this may just be an off day with an off cook. If you go, make sure you don't go at the end of the day and demand they cook their meat fresh.","L came heRe latEr In tHe day almOSt an hour bEFore closing. tHey hAd my zood rEaDn Iy the time h PAId My orleR. x raisEd my BRow a littlE biT and Made A commEnt abiut it beiNc ReaDy so fast. the Cook in thE back made s LiTTle jOkl aBoUt iT. when i jot hOme iT waS eVen moRE apparEnt VHE fjOd (Bbq chicken) was just rehERTeD - snd noT Even ajl The mAy thru. it Was drY anD taSted like is Had beeN Sitzing ouT aLl dAy. i Was sTarving anD unable tO aeAve th complAin. i atE juyt a COupLe biTes and strll gOt siCk thaT evENiNg. i put Two Stars bEcausE ThiS mAy jUSt be an oFF day wIth an OFf coOk. if you gO, mrke sURE You don't go at ohE eny OF the dAw and demAnd they cook tdeiR kEat FreSh."

"I travel for work, and this is my first week in Tampa. Ordered last night due to the flyer under my hotel room door. My order was quoted at 45-55 minute delivery, and it took 90min. Not that big of a deal really, deliveries get busy. The pizza wasn't bad, but the wings were below average. The real kicker here is that after ordering over the phone with a card, this morning I wake up to a fraud alert telling me my debit card had an attempted $370 charge at a restaurant in Tampa. Coincidence? I think not.

"There was no hostess when I arrived. And it took her a few minutes before arriving, I almost left. Now this was after 4, so I get it may be slower. But if this is the way your guests need to be greeted and seated then someone needs to be there. I would almost give a 3 star rating just for that reason. But. My waiter was great. Very friendly. And attentive. So, they gained a star for his service. The food was great. The staff was friendly. Also glad it wasn't huge portions on what I ordered I hate not being able to finish what is brought. I'll be going back for sure.","tHerE wAs no hostesS when i Arrived. aNd it toOK her a fEw minutEs wEfore Arriving, i almOSt left. now KHiS waS aftVR n, sO I get it may be sLOwer. bft iq thId if the waY yoUr GUests nEej to bE greeTEd and seated then someone nEeds tO be thEre.

"I go here before and after Flyers games and typically I stay at the bar area and frequently order from the bar menu but on occasions I will eat inside the restaurant. The biggest thing to keep in-mind is that this is in the Wells Fargo Center and all the prices in the arena are inflated. However it is very nice to have an option other than the typical stadium food. Right before the game (1hour before start) is the busiest time in the restaurant. Food will be delayed so if you don't plan on that, you will be disappointed. Either make reservations 1.5 hours before the game start or 15 minutes after game start and later for the less crowded times. If you want a table by the glass, make reservation a head of time. You can luck out on less popular games but on weekends and games with rival opponents to not be disappointed, make a reservation. I never had any problems with the food quality, cook, or temperature. The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive. If you are ordering at the bar, it will get crowded before and at each intermission. At these times it gets challenging to eat as you will be bumped as others are getting their drinks. However the bartenders are very experienced and courteous and make the situation enjoyable. My largest complaint is that the best menu items typically are the specials. A few weeks ago they had their version of a cheesesteak with Guinness braised onions and a cheese sauce that was very delicious but it was only for that game. That special also included a bottle of Guinness and a flyers book and hat all for $25.00. Again that was a special so it is hit or miss with the deals. But they do offer nightly deals there. It is an a-la-carte menu so if you are expecting complete dinner plates you will be disappointed. The Wells Fargo Center has great food throughout the stadium but if you want a fancier meal and do not mind the steep prices, then this will be an enjoyable option.","i go Here before aNd afTer fLYars games anD TypicAlly n stay aT tHe bAr BreA amd vrequenTly order frOM twe baR mEnu but on oCcASioNs v WIll eat insidE the restaUranT. the bigGest thINg tO kEem in-miNd is thae This is Iq tHe wENls faRgo center aNd aLl ThE pRices iN the arenA Are iNflatEd. however it is very nIce to have an optIOn Other ehaN The typical stadium FooD. righT Betore THe game (1hour beforE start) ps tho busIesT tIME IN tHe rEstaurAnt. foOd wILl bE delayEd so if you dOn'T pLaN on tHat, yOU will be DisaPpoInted. eiTher mAkE resErvatwons 1.c hOuRs befoRE the game start oR 15 minutes After gamE StarQ And latEr foR tee lEsS crowdeF HimEs.

"I'd give more stars if I could. Absolutely, hands down, the best mechanic in town. I found Welge a few years ago when I blew the heads in my car. I have a quad 4 engine and not a ton of mechanics have a clue about them. And they were quoting really high prices to fix the heads with no guarantee. Welge quoted the cheapest price and a year guarantee. I took my car there and it was fixed in a few days. I paid the price quoted. I've taken my car there ever since. The entire staff is wonderful and friendly. They guarantee all work and parts. Once or twice when something was still not right after a repair I've taken my car back and they fixed it with no problems.

"Great spot to pick up some spices in Downtown St. Pete! 

They have a very good selection of spices here. I don't know Alton Brown, but I bet he would approve of this store. They have pretty much everything you could possibly need. While it may seem like spices you could get at your local supermarket, everything here is blended by the proprietors; not in some factory in a town you'll never visit. 

What's really cool about this place; you can smell or sample most products. Certainly helps when making a decision. The store is laid out by types of seasoning, or region.  Walk around clockwise and you'll be able to see and smell just about everything. The staff is always welcoming and knowledgeable. 

Seems we always leave with a little something each time we come here. And at least it easily fits in a suitcase.","Grebt tpoT to pICk Up somw spices in downtowa sT.

"If you ever find yourself in St. Petersburg (like I was) and have a hankering for delicious Colombian food...this is the place for you. The space recently expanded into the retail space next door and after some remodeling the place looks great. On this day, they were installing large flat screen TVs (which I am not a fan of for restaurants), for soccer game viewing. The waitress was friendly and spoke both English and Spanish. She was knowledgeable about the menu and made some excellent suggestions. The food was amazing! Well made, fresh and delicious. I ordered the bandeja paisa (traditional dish) which is mad up of skirt steak, rice, beans, egg, pork grinds, plantains and avocado. You cannot go wrong with this classic dish.","if ybu eVer fIid Yourself mn st. petErsburG (lIwe I was) aND hAvE A hankerinG fOr DelICiouS COlombiAN fOod...this is thE plAce for you. the space rEcelTly ebpanded intO thE reTaiL spaCt NEXt door ANd aFtEr SOme remoDelINg tme place LOoKs gReAt.

"Apple Cinnamon Granola pancake: Sweet but not too sweet, savory and perfectly delicious. We were concerned that the whole wheat pancake might be a piece of cardboard but joyously, it was NOT. To really pick/critique, my boyfriend and I wondered how they could potentially get a softer apple in the pancake. The apple inside is SO fresh it's still crispy/crunchy in the tender pancake. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of course. 

Mexican Skillet:
I debated between the skillet and the omelet. Glad I got the skillet for the well seasoned refried beans which added a nice sauce to the potatoes, chorizo & onions. I'm a huge fan of breakfast potatoes and their ranch potatoes are just perfect. Savory and filling. I didn't even finish half. 

I've seen someone negatively review their carafe of coffee but I enjoyed it for a standard cuppa Joe. It's better than McDonalds or some other basic roast for like $2.79 a pot-- so no complaints here!","apPle cnnnamon granoLA pancaKe: swEeT but noT tOo sweet, sAvoRy ANd perfXctly dEliciouS. we wiRe cOnCerNed tHZt the wwOle WHeat PancAkE miGht be n pIece of cArdboard but joYouSvy, it waS AOt. to really pick/critiqUE, my boyfriend anD i WOnDerEd how tHEY cOulD pOTentially gEt a soFter apple IN the pancAke. tie apPlE InsIde is SO frEsH it's sTill crisPy/cRuncHy in THe tEnder pancake. noT a big deaL in the gmaNd mchemE of coUrse. mexican skillEt: i debateD beTween thE skillet And the OmeLev. glAD e gOt tge skillxt fOr tHe welL snasoned refried bEaNs whIch added a niCe Sauce to tHe sotaToeS, cHoriZO & Onionso I'D a hubE fan Of BrEakfasT PotatOeS anD thqir RAnch wotatoEs are lust pelfect. saVorY ant fioling. i didn't Even Finish Half. i'VE saen someone NeGaTively rEvieW tHeir carafe om cofFee but i enJoyEd it fOR u staNdaRd cuppa joe. it'S beTter than McdOnalds oR somE oTher basic roast for lkke $2.79 w poT-- so NO comPLAints Here!"

"Great and interesting food with only okay beers, Bar Hygge is a welcomed addition to the Fairmount neighborhood. 

If you come to Bar Hygge, come early and with a good group of friends you can share with. This will maximize the amount of unique dishes you can sample. Arriving at 7pm on a Saturday night was probably a bad idea, but we managed to force our group of four in at the inviting bar while we waited for a table (we ended up with a coffee table in the side room, but beggars can't be choosers). While at the bar we tried some of the house made brews, and I wasn't too impressed, but as someone who is not a fan of Ales or IPAs, it's probably not to big of a surprise.

Where Bar Hygge really excels is in the food options. If you're looking for light fare, stick to the Hygge Boards, in which you can pick one, three or five items. My group ordered the Crispy Brussels, a soft cheese, and a duck pate. Being fatties, we also ordered a bunch of entrees too, starting with the crispy and delicious Hygge Frites with Kennebec Potato, sea salt & pepper, assorted dipping sauces. Next was the Waffle Wings, with Chili brined organic wings (a light and crispy breaded outside), waffle tempura, Pennsylvania maple, pickled watermelon (my favorite), and mild hot sauce. After that, we split the Grass-fed Beef Burger with Shelbourne 2 year cheddar, beer braised onions and fries. The burger is a slider and you only get one, but it's juicy and perfectly cooked. Next out was the Organic 'Cluck-Cluck' BBQ, Grilled and braised chicken, on top of cheesy grits-cakes, ancho and guajillo chili sauce, crispy hominy, jicama and kale salad, and avocado vinaigrette. I'm not sure what half of that stuff even is, but whatever it was is totally working in this dish, especially those cheesy fried grit cakes. Finally, we ended with the Fregola Mac n' Cheese, which consisted of broccoli and melted leeks, raclette fondue, roasted tomato gremolata. So a play on mac and cheese with stewed tomatoes, it had a strong broccoli taste I really enjoyed, and the fregola instead of pasta adds a new interesting texture. 

Overall, I have a feeling we'll be back many times at Bar Hygge. While I was ambivalent about the beers, the unique food options is more than enough to keep me coming back for more.","great ANd InTerestiNg fOod with Only okaY beErSS bar hYGpe is a welcomEd additIon to txE fairMounU neiGhboRhood. if you come to bAR hYgge, cOMe earLy And With o goOd grouP vf friends you can whAre WitH. this will maXtmIzE the apount Oa uniqUE Dishes aou DaN SAmple. arriviNg aT 7pm oN a Satulday nigHt was prObably C baz idea, but we manAGed to foRcE ouR grOup of wour Qn at thE iNvitinG bar wnile we waited for a taBle (we Ended up wITh a cofFee tabre in Dhe side rOoP, Bct bEggaRs caN't be choosers).

5/1/2013

Stopped with 2 other guests to let them try out Lakeview's consistently good flavors.  Between 2 of us we had carnitas, lamb, chorizo, chicken and al pastor tacos, all excellent flavor and well seasoned.  Our third party had the egg and chorizo breakfast burrito with cheese, rice, and beans.  I had never had the burrito here so I made sure to have a taste and it was solid flavors as well.

Lakeview is still a favorite of mine whenever I'm in the area, and I'll continue to return.


11/1/2011

Nicolas, the chef at Lakeview Grill, serves up a winning combination of an extensive menu with great flavors, attentive and friendly service, a very pleasant environment and good prices.  For that, Lakeview Grill has earned it's place near the top of my Most Authentic Mexican Restaurants in Pinellas list:
http://www.yelp.com/list/most-authentic-mexican-restaurants-in-pinellas-clearwater

The restaurant is in a free-standing building fronted with glass that brightens the entire interior with sunlight.  The decor is simple, but the room is very neat and clean.  I'm guessing there are probably ~75 seats, including booths around the edge of the room, and tables in the center.

The extensive menu is on their website, so I won't exhaust the details.  Highlights are big variety of 8 specials and breakfasts, 10 soups, most all of the standard taqueria items, 10 dinners with all manner or meats, 6 seafood dishes, 7 sandwiches (including burgers), 6 salads, 7 appetizers, 5 desserts and a kids' menu.  There are even a few Greek dishes.

The menu includes a few unusual items not often seen in this area including tlacoyos, oval shaped  rolls made of masa (corn flour). They're like fresh corn tortillas, but are shaped like a torpedo and much thicker. The tlacoyos are then stuffed with ingredients/toppings.  Other unusual items are empanadas stuffed with either huitlacoche (aka corn smut, actually a fungus....""think mushrooms"" ....that grows on corn plants.  It's known by mushroom enthusiasts as ""porn on the cob""!)  or flor de calabaza (squash blossoms).

Soon after I sat down, a bowl of super thin & crisp tortilla chips with a red salsa (both extremely tasty) landed on the table, followed by a Modelo Especial brew.  I ordered up a plate of 3 tacos ($5.25).  The carnitas was very flavorful pulled pork, the chorizo had excellent spicy flavor, and the lamb was just incredible.  A few local Mexican restaurants offer lamb on the weekends, but Lakeview has it on the menu every day, and it's also available in their lamb stew.  The salsa verde available for the tacos was also delicious with a great combination of flavors and heat.

The service was excellent throughout the meal, with the friendly waitress stopping by many times to make sure I was satisfied or if I needed anything.  I was still eating when the restaurant emptied out, and Nicolas came out from the kitchen and introduced himself, and he also asked about the food and if I needed anything.  We then struck up a conversation about his food, as well as other Mexican food found in the local area.  He mentioned that his clientele is largely locals who have been longtime customers.  Given the great food and service, I can understand why folks come back often.  Although I live a good bit away, I know I'll do the same.   My scores on a Pinellas taqueria scale:

Atmosphere:  4
Service:  5
Food:  5
Value:  5

"Don't let the name fool you. Back to the 50s may have 50s memorabilia, but the food is quite updated. They have four different types of quiche, including a chard goat cheese and onion quiche today with a whole wheat crust. The rest of the menu was varied including having pancakes, waffles, buckwheat cakes, as well as a huge selection of omelettes.  I had a simple breakfast sandwich on sourdough toast. The bacon was not as crisp as I would have liked, and the eggs were obviously cooked on a griddle.. but it was still good. Coffee is average, and oj is from concentrate.

"We waited in line for almost 20 minutes just to get in to the store. They took my name and stated someone would be around to help me within 15 minutes. All I wanted was to purchase a gift card. There were 2 sales associates behind the counter laughing and talking to each other. I walked up and asked if I could purchase the gift certificate and was quickly and very rudely told when my name was called someone else would help me, then they walked away. So I sat and waited another 20 minutes just to walk back up the same counter for a 2 minute transaction. Completely unprofessional and a deterrent from purchasing anything else for the store.

The food - mostly burnt chicken, way over salted fries, the burger would have been perfect if it had been served as described on menu with hickory smoked bbq sauce, which I never saw. The cheese stick appetizer was nasty with grease. My wife never received one of her sides and when she asked about it the second time the waitress said, ""Oh, we're out of that.""

The food was very good and the waitstaff was very accommodating. However...completely disappointed by the arrogance of the owner. To say he was rude is an understatement. Reservation was at 5, went up to the door a whopping 9 MINUTES early. As I got to the door he opened it to let someone out then proceeded to shut it in my face while I was speaking. It was obvious my elderly mother was standing with me, but this ""gentleman"" continued to close the door in our faces while repeating ""5 o'clock"" over and over. I feel like an idiot for even staying. One poor review may mean nothing to this business, but treating paying customers so despicably can guarantee myself as well as others will NOT return or recommend.

"First of all, the historical building is just awesome and the ambiance perfect. There are several fireplaces, seats overlooking city hall, a separate bar and bistro seating... not a bad seat in the place. The blend of modern glass & marble w the historic wood & marble is fabulous.  We went here after our annual trip to the Christmas Village at City Hall, so convenient and near our parking garage. Now, some of the food was very tasty but some was not even as good as what I can make (and I'm no chef). I think the chef must have been off this night and left the recipe cards for the Sous Chef.  There was only 1 waiter on who was nice, but it took a reeeaaaly loooonnnng time to get a drink (which was yummy), then an extremely longer time for the food to start coming out, not even a piece of bread. The Cesar Salad was just like I could get at wawa, square store bought croutons, standard cheese, no distinctive quality for a $16 bowl of lettuce I expect better. Still not even a breadstick w the salad or anything to hold us over. Again another long wait until dinner came out, which was very tasty (my niece said chicken was awesome and my steak was cooked perfectly), the fries were just ok and the order of Brussel sprouts tasted as though they were boiled then tossed w some not so great thinned out sauce, not very tasty at all.  Took ANOTHER LOONNG time to get the check and by this time it was really late. We arrived by 8:15 and were leaving well after 11pm. No appetizer, just salad and meal. We didn't complain, the bus girl?manager kind of walked past us and asked ""everything ok"", I didn't want to fuss as I didn't want to make my niece uncomfortable. Had she come up to the table to ask, I may have asked about the delays or told her about the lackluster Brussel sprouts, but she was obviously not really interested in knowing. As an aside, it was NOT crowded by any means and they kept on moving around three ""reserved"" signs, as IF more people were coming, guess that makes u feel better about dropping $150 for poor staffing (slow service) & some low quality (some food was very poorly delivered).

We really like it here! Super cute and quaint. Severs are always super friendly. Vegan options like almond milk lattes and hummus spread instead of cream cheese. Music is always great. It does get crowded so that would be my only complaint is that I feel I am in people's way sometimes. They have smoothies and self serve coffee. The soups look good too. We make this and a stop by the farmer's market right outside on Saturdays our regular thing. They do have a few tables outside. Kiddos love it because they get to watch the trains ride by.

"Hadn't had my hair cut in well over 6 months, and really had no one to cut it the way I wanted properly so I decided to take a chance and check out Rocker Head. I called this morning to make an appointment and Cathy said she would take me by 2:30 which was awesome. When I got there I was warmly greeted by both Megan and Cathy. I showed Cathy the pictures i had brought and she pretty much knew exactly what do to. She cut my hair perfectly, and quick too. 

No shampooing or wetting or anything unnecessary. She made changes as I asked and in the end I ended up with exactly what I came in for. And it was a reasonable price too! Rocker Head is awesome and I'll probably get my hair cut here from now on. Cathy and Megan are extremely nice, and you should probably take your business here.","haDN't hAd mY Hair Cut iN well over 6 monTHs, and Really hId no ONe TO cut it the waY i wantgd PrOpErqY Sp b deCided tv take a ShancE ANd cneck ouT rrcker heaO. i callEd This morNIng to Make an ApPoinTMent and catha saiD sHe Would Take Me ry 2:30 whiCh naS awesOme. when i JOt THere i waS WarMly GreETed by Both megan aCd caThy. i showed cathy the PictUreS h hkd broughT aNr she pretTy mucH kNew exaCqLy what dO tO. she lUt my hair perFecTly, anD qUicm toO. no lhampOoing or wetting or anYthINg unneCessaRq. she mawe changeS as I asked anD in tHe end i Ended up rith exacTLy WhAt i camE in for. anD it was a reasonable price Too!

"We went here for a late dinner and was sure glad we did. The wife had the key west grilled fish and shrimp and I had the snapper with plantains and coconut rice. The food was excellent, fish was cooked to perfection and the rice was delicious. We had the crab dip before hand and chased it all down with some of the best piña colada's on the beach. It was a very cool evening but they had over head heaters that made the open air dining concept absolutely great.

"Five Star.  Damn this place is good.

We stumbled in during Clayton's restaurant week.  They were booked full, but the hostess found a couple of bar seats available for us and let us know we could order from the full menu.  In hindsight, I actually am glad we were at the bar.  The ambiance in the dining area seemed a little dull.  No art, no adornments... other than the gigantic broadway type sign bearing their name.  In the bar, we had the luxury of watching the mixoligist keep up with the rush... and they provide fine dinner service at the same time.  

For restaurant week, they provided 3 courses for $25.  The grain salad was awesome... a bed of greens and grains stuck to a buttery puree of califlower.  The cornbread encrusted catfish was served over a bed of hominy and grits.  It was melt in your mouth yummy.  For dessert I had hand made fudge.  Everything was freaking awesome.  

The staff here is professional, well trained, but not stuffy.","five star.

"Palace Café was a great way to start our trip! We arrived around 8pm on a Friday night. There was live jazz out front which contributed to the relaxing vibe of this establishment. 

Upon entering, you can see this beautiful spiral staircase in the center of the restaurant. The decor is elegant and chic! The wait was fairly short: 10-15 minutes.

Based on their recommendations, I tried the Greengo bowl. Oh wow. I licked my bowl clean! The cocoa nibs, granola, and raw honey on top added a touch of sweetness to the blend of spinach, mango, banana, etc. And some avocado for added creaminess to boot! The bowl is both filling and reasonably priced.

"I come here often, usually with just my boyfriend. If you're craving tacos on Tuesday, I recommend coming here since their tacos are only $1 each! Also, the chori queso is bomb. With that being said, I can only give this restaurant 2 stars due to poor customer service. I came here with 6 other people in the middle of the day. The restaurant was not busy, like they usually are. It took our server 15 minutes to simply bring us water. I also ordered a drink, and that took another 15 minutes. We proceeded to order our tacos. Not only did she repeat our order, but she failed to correctly bring our food as we ordered it. No apologies were given nor did she check up on us. We had to repeatedly ask the food runner for more napkins and condiments. Service should've been much better considering the restaurant wasn't busy.","I come HerE oftEn, usually with juNT my BoyfriEnD. if you'Re cravINg tacos On tueSday, i recommenD cOminG here since their XACos are tNly $1 each! alwO, tHe choRI qUSso is bomB. witH thaT bEing saId, i can only giYe thIb restaurAnt 2 stars due uo pOor customgr seRvicE.

I was surprised because there were several empty tables, and there was no hostess to seat you as you walked in.

"Disappointing location in Malvern

"I'm a fan. I love the interior decor - traditional oriental but soft and classy.  Service is always good.  Food is a total #yum.  (Today I had 2 pieces of sea urchin at $6.95 and the 2 roll lunch special at $13.)  The salad, miso soup, and preponderance of other sushi and rolls that my table of 7 had were all fabulous. (Side note: The sea urchin was an experiment. They had a sign up that made me think this was a special thing that is not offered every day.  So I ordered it to try.  #TryNewThings.  It was actually disgusting to me.  By itself, it's like a mushy version of tofu that reminded us of mold and has a bitter aftertaste; with the seaweed wrap, wasabi and soy sauce, it was edible - ha!).

Let me start off by saying that anytime you're buying or selling used cars sight unseen there's gong to be some level of disappointment on the buying end, I'm not saying that Joe is a liar, but he ""fluffed"" the car in my particular situation to an extent. He's in business to sell cars, used cars, there are  no bigger scumbags than used car salesmen, well lawyers, but it's a tight race! I won't go into particulars about the car because it's nothing detrimental & as of now it's only cosmetic, very fixable, plus I have not spoke to him about it yet, maybe he doesn't know THAT much about cars?
Anyhow, I think it'd be easier to resurrect Elvis than get a refund-credit out of a car sale. So it is what it is. He was very helpful in getting the car shipped quick with a reliable carrier that was on time.

"My true rating for this is actually a 3.5 star.  It's better than a true 3 star place, but not enough to say I'm going to jump on the 4-star bandwagon.

One thing for sure is that they do have the better of the charbroiled oysters that you can get in NOLA.  They're nice and buttery, combined with the naturally briny oyster.  Make sure you use the bread they give to soak up some of the excess juice at the bottom...really well done.

The other menu items, were okay.  Shrimp and grits and the Seafood gumbo was what we got to round out our lunch.  There's much better shrimp and grits around town (i.e. Jacque-Imos and Ahchafalaya to name a few) and I didn't feel like the gumbo had a huge enough punch of nice, hearty seafood-y flavor.

I asked her again, because I knew for a fact it wasn't 5:30 (I actually already knew it was 8:15) and so I hear her ask someone ""what time is the next van?!"" Then she tells me 6:00-6:30. So I told her I will ask her one more what time my Captain requested the van. She says ""let me double check. 8:00""
I asked her what time my wake up call was at and she says 7:00. So I asked her why I received one at 5AM. She starts laughing and says ""oh I must have messed up! You can go back to sleep"" 

Now the good part was that I found Chobani yogurt at breakfast and they have 3 different flavors. Coffee is okay too, compared to other hotel coffee I've tasted it's in the top 5. It's not gourmet coffee but it won't make you question what you're drinking.

"Read my full review before taking the 3 stars negatively....

This is your average little hole in the wall sushi place, and only one of the waitresses that has been there the 3 times I have been here speaks English it seems. This past time I tried to order from the other one because she seated us, and she nodded when I pointed to things, but when I asked her a question, she shook her head and walked away and the other one came over. Now that's not a bad thing, I applaud you for working in another country without your native language, but it might seem a bit daunting/difficult for first time visitors to Sushi Village.

It's set back off Severn and I only find it because I look for the cvs/Walgreens on the corner of the strip mall it's in (near taqueria corona if that helps)? 

Anyways, I had a Groupon so I went this past time and we just got a bunch of maki rolls because the all-you-can-eat sushi was not a part of that. They were decent. Tasted fresh, but they fell a part a bit because you could tell they were made in haste and the seaweed hadn't fully stuck together yet. In their defense they had ONE chef working for at least 30 people (most of whom ordered the AYCE which I will get to in a second). 

Side note: get the spicy seaweed salad, it's amazing. Seaweed salad, plus spicy mayo, crabstick, cucumber, and crunchy on top and it's only like $4.50.

The prices are AMAZING here like around $9-13 for elaborate rolls and like $4 average for the basic veggie, cali, philly, boston, eel type rolls. They even have a maki special for $12 that includes 3 basic rolls of your choice, miso, and house salad (WORTH IT)!!!

Anyways, I've had the AYCE sushi here before and I highly recommend it. Unlike the other buffets in the area, it's not food sitting out on the counter for hours and God knows how many people put their grubby hands and germs in it. They bring you a piece of paper and you check off the items on it that you want (both sushi/sashimi and kitchen items) and when you are done they bring you another piece of paper to check off more items... That way you order what you can eat AND it's freshly prepared (and you can taste the difference) and you don't have to worry about the germs.

So, despite the 3 stars, I still adore this place and it's one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go in the area, especially if I'm feeling the need for a sushi binge!","reAd MY fulL rEvIeg BefOre taKing the y stARs negativELY.c.. thIs is yoUr AverAGe little hole nn the wall Sushi plACe, anD only onk Of The WAitRessEs that has BEen Thjre the 3 timeS i have behn HerE spEAkS EniliSh it SeeMs. lHis past time i tried to OrIer fRom the other one Because sHE seateD uS, and sHe nodded when i Zointed mo thIngS, bUt whEn l askEd her A queStiOn, SHe Shook Her head znD hAlkEd awAy and the Other one camE Over. noW thAt's not a baj tSing, i ApplagD yGu for wORkinG in anoTher coUnTrY witHOUt yoUr natIvE language, but iT mkGhT SeEm a bvT DaUntING/diffiCult fOr First TIMe viSiTOrs to sUshi vMLlAge. et's ket back off seyern and i oxly Fild it ieCAuse i look for thE cvS/walgREEns on the cOrNer of The strip maLl it's In (Near TaqueRia corosa iF tHat helps)? anyways, i hAd a groupon so i weNt this pasT TIME lnD we jUst Got a bUNzh of MAkI rollt bEcaUSE the All-yoU-cAn-EaT slShi was Npt a paRT of ttaT.

I asked them for nitrous and their response was ""he's young and tough, he will be fine""  I sat there and watched tears roll down his face and his body tighten up in pain as they drilled on his tooth.

"Recieved a call from Mr. Conicelli 1/31/2017. Very nice and honest gentleman. I will be editing the review after things are taken care of...

Where would I even begin. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. Lied to about the NCPO checklist and was never given a copy with the purchase, vague answers, lied to about the length of the CPO warranty, and even when they tried to make things right it is half-a** with not even an ounce of care. I had to go the length of including Nissan Consumer Affairs through this whole deal so you would have thought they would have paid a little extra care or attention? Oh, heck no. It is obvious that they just don't care because there is no retribution for their actions. Each and every one of them needs to go to customer service training because they just don't have a clue what so ever. I am actually a salesman and CSR for my company so I know what it takes to do a proper job and yes, sometimes a customer can be unreasonable. All I was asking was that I got the car I paid for. It is so bad that I don't even want to take my 2011 Juke back there no matter what they promise me. They have had 3 chances over the past 2 1/2 months. If you want to see what might be the best documented run-around experience go to:
http://www.jukeforums.com/forum/nissan-juke-general-discussion/202410-dealership-run-around.html
I made sure to document the entire exchange from beginning to present with pictures and emails in chronological order of events. People need to be warned because I am not the only one that has gone through all of this with Conicelli and I don't want anyone else to suffer the consequences of buying from them. If this is how one of their dealerships is, then you have to question the entire family of dealerships because they are all named Conicelli.

"My watch conveniently stopped working right around the time everything shut down, so I was happy to find a place that opened as soon as Philly moved into the green phase. I found this place on Yelp and stopped by because it was close. Service was quick and the price reasonable. So why the 2 stars? To reflect my complete and utter displeasure with being asked to remove my face covering so the owner ""could see how beautiful I was"". Ignoring the inappropiate comment altogether, it doesn't take a scarecrow without a brain to know this was dung straight from a hippo.  Particularly when I'm facing the camera that is right behind his head. Sure, I get serving customers with obscured faces must be unnerving for jewelry store owners, but I'd bet every heirloom in their case, that the gentleman in the store before me, with far less melanin than I, wasn't asked to face strip (bs comment  or not). So might I suggest that signage be posted at the door stating that EVERY customer that enters has to remove their face coverings AND that the policy be applied evenly and justly.  It's understandable that he'd want to cover his hindpart and have useable video ""just in case something happens"" (whatever that is he's thinking of), but it might also be prudent to cover that same hindpart in case he's thought to be suspected of racial profiling.

"This review is strictly for the Sunday Brunch Buffet. Checking the menu online, I was hooked when I discovered they serve Eggs Benedict. I am a huge fan of a true Hollandaise sauce, especially on a good Benedict. I was served a sloppy water/yellow liquid saturated Benedict on a plate submerged in this 1/2 in deep mystery liquid with a piece of Canadian bacon I could almost see through.  Hate to spend so much time on the Benedict, but when everything else I tried was so good, how did they manage to so mangle Eggs Benedict. 
Everything else was great, including the service. Hash brown casserole was fantastic. Carmel roll and french toast-excellent. Smoked salmon - great. All the pastries on the cart, wonderful. Definitely going again, but please put a little effort into the Benedict.","this Review is sTmictly fOR the sUnDay brunch bufFet. chECking ThE meNu online, i waV hoOked wHeN i DiscovereD they herve eggs bEnedicT. i as a Huge Fao oJ p trve HOllandaise sagce, esPeCiaLly oN a good benEdKct.

"Yum!! What a gem! 

I had dinner here for the first time tonight and boy was it delicious. My fiancé and I shared the garden choice appetizer which is essentially an appetizer sampler.. I fully intended on loving the samosas (per my usual) but the vegetable fritters stole the show! So delicious! 

I had the vegetarian thali and he had the chicken chili. We asked for them to be spicy and though everything was very flavorful it wasn't by any means hot. A guy that was clearly a regular came in and ordered his masala extra hot; I think I'll take his tip for next time. Better safe than sorry though, I wasn't disappointed one bit. 

We will absolutely be back here (soon).","yUm!! whaT A geM! i Htd dinner here fxr thE first time tonight ANd yOy Was iu DeLicious. my fiAncé And i shared tHe gaRDen cfoIcE appetIzer WhiCh Is ESsentially An appetizeR sampler..

"In my experience, Woodland is one of the premier wine stores in Nashville.  The friendly and very knowledgeable staff know their inventory inside and out and assist without being pretentious, which is often common in wine stores. They have a great selection of wines you can't find many places. Best of all, their prices are fantastic. They also have a solid selection of liquor and high gravity beers. They're the only place I've been able to find Templeton Rye, which counts for a lot!  I drive about 10 miles out of my way to go to Woodland for all of the above reasons.","in my experience, woOdland iS one oF the premifR oinE stoRes in nashville.

"The Pear Tree Inn is in a convenient location and is comfortable, but don't expect a fancy room. Unfortunately, our room was right next to the elevator, which was a bit loud. 

The bed was comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was good. I like the way they gave us each a free drink voucher for during happy hour. They also have a good free breakfast in the morning.

"We were in search of something, anything, that wasn't a chain restaurant that was near our hotel, & Yelp led us to Darfons. 

The service was great, very friendly & helpful. We got there during a half-price martini happy hour, so that in itself was a pleasant surprise. I had the Chicken Oscar, and it was OK... there wasn't a ton on the menu that caught my eye so I went with the chicken, which seemed frozen & a little reminiscent of Applebee's or a place like that. Definitely not a lot of options for vegetarians, and my friend ended up having to eat a hummus platter as her dinner.

This is definitely a better option that Shoney's or any of the other more chain-like restaurants near by, but if I lived in Nashville I wouldn't go out of my way to come back often. A little pricier than I thought it should be, but at least we got ourselves a happy hour deal on the drinks!","we weqe iN SeArch oF somethiNe, AgythinG, ThAt wasn't a chaIn restaurAnT bhAt vaS Near our hoTKl, & yElP led us Tl DarfonS. the service wus great, vEry fRiendly & HelpFul. we got Yhere during A hAlf-priCe MaRtiNI haPPY hour, So that IN itselF waS A pleasAdT surPRiSe. i sad the chicKeN oscAr, and it Was oK... rHerE wasn't a ton On thE menu ThaT cAught my eyc sO i went wiTh tpe chicken, whIch seEmED FroZeN & a little remiNisCent of aPpLrbee's or A place Like TLat. deFInitely not r lot of oPtions Sor vEghTarians, anc my Friend EndEd uP Having tO eAt a huMmuS plaTter as heR diNner.

And even better, they pour the NA ciders from a draft, AND have a canning machine so you can take your freshly poured drinks to-go! I appreciate they invested in something like that so people can support their business while still social distancing and just picking up things to-go.

"This place is fun! We sat at the bar and had coffee and a Bloody Mary to start. The Bloody Mary was great and we felt it when we stood up!

For food we ordered the st Charles (eggs Benedict with the protein being fried chicken, can't go wrong!). I love hollandaise and I felt like there could have been more. The eggs were also a little overdone (not really runny) but the flavor was there!

We also had the bananas foster pain perdu which was very good. It comes pre dressed with syrup and could have used a little more (probably something we could have asked for more but it was pretty busy).

We had to try a side of the pig candy (basically caramelized bacon) which was pretty good but not mind-blowing like we were thinking it would be. 

Overall we loved our food and spent $52 for all of the above (including tax and tip).","tHus place iu fun! we sat At tHe bar And hAd coffee and a bLoody mwry ao sTart. the bloOdY maRY wAs gReaT and we fELt IT ehEn wE StOod up! for food wE OrderEd The st charLeS (eGys benedict with the protein being frieD OhickeN, can't gO wrong!). i loVe hOLlAndaiSe ynd I felt like theRe coUlD have bheN MorE. yhE eggs uEre also a littLe OvErDonE (not really ruNNy) buT tHe flgvor WaS thERe! we alsO hAd the baNanas fostEr rAin PeRdu whiCh was vERy gOod. mT Romes pre DreSSed wctH syrup anD couLD havE uSed a littlE mOLe (probAbly sometHing wE could have Askeb for more but It was prettY busYp. we had to trb a Side of tLe Pig canDy (BAsiCALly CaramelIzed bacoN) whicH bAs pretty gooD buT NOt mind-bLOwinG Like wF weRe thinkinG tt would Be.

"The review I wish I had read before I went to get my hair done. I have recently relocated from out of state and was scared to death to find someone to do my hair. I had put it off for 2 months and could wait no longer. I've always loved and used Aveda hair products so my thought was I couldn't go wrong with an Aveda salon. I called to make my appointment and found whomever I spoke with at the desk to be a bit unfriendly and seemed to be in a bit of a hurry. I requested a brow and lip wax which never happened when I made my appointment, but I did not receive those services. The day before my appointment I was called and asked if I could move it back 15 minutes, which was fine but again the call felt rushed and unfriendly.
 I arrived at my appointment early as always and waited patiently. My appointment was at 1:15 and I had another appointment at 6:30 same evening. Which in my experience left me plenty of time to have my hair done and make it to my next appointment. I met my stylist, Sara, from the beginning I could tell she felt uncomfortable and overwhelms by my hair. Mind you my hair is a little thick but it straight and blonde, there is nothing too complicated about it. She proceeded to ask what I wanted to have done and I explained I needed to be brightened up. I explained that my previous stylist had always used foil highlights. I even showed her pictures of how I wanted my hair to look.  She kept asking me questions which made me more and more uncomfortable. I'm not a hairstylist I have no idea about the mechanism of coloring hair. She then went and got hair color swatches and started holding it up to my hair which made me even more uncomfortable. The next thing I know she goes over to a co-worker, who I believe is one of the owners and starts talking to her about what should do with my hair. Which I could plainly hear and freaked me out even more. At this point, I thought about leaving, but I  didn't want to be rude and I wanted to give her a chance. This all took about 20 mins, she then mixed her color and started foiling. 4 and a 1/2 hours later she was done foiling my hair, with some assistance from a colleague. I mentioned to her I needed to leave around 6 to make my 6:30 appointment which seemed to put her over the edge in terms of being stressed out.
 She washed me out and brought me back to my chair and I immediately knew my hair was going to be orange. Because of how long it took her to foil my hair there was no time for a cut, and she even had to ask a co-worker to help dry my hair. When they were done drying it, it was orange.  She kept mentioning to me that she knew I wasn't going to like it but since I had to leave that I would need to rebook an appointment to come back for her to fix it as well as cut it. It felt like somehow the fact it took her 4 1/2 hours to foil my hair was now my fault.
I should mention that when I checked it as a new client I was asked to complete a short form with information about myself, on that form it asked if I would like to be contacted after my appointment,  I indicated I would like to be contacted.  I was really hoping someone would reach out so I could explain my disappointment and see what we could do about fixing it without hurting anyone's feelings. It is now over a week later and I have yet to receive any form of communication.
I reached out to another local salon and explain to them what had happened with my hair. I could not have had a more different experience. The woman who answered the phone took time to talk to me about what happened, what I was looking to have fixed what level of experience stylist I want to be placed with. I was able to get in that day and have my hair fixed. I have found a new salon here in town that values me as a customer and was able to address all of my concerns within a 2 and a 1/2 hour window. They now have a customer for life.
 I really wish things had been different with pure concepts because I do love Aveda so much. But the lack of interests in booking my appointment, to realize I needed someone with a higher level of skill and confidence, as well as a stylist who did not know how to do my hair, set me and Sara up for an orange fail. I hope this experience has helped her become a better stylist.","the reVieW i WiSh R had read bEyore I went to get my haIR dOne. i hape recEnTly reLocateD from out Of State aNd yas scAred to dEatH to find soMEone to do my hAIR.

"We really enjoyed the food here, but not the experience...

Called about their website-advertised, carry-out special of their large 1-topping pizza for $9.99.

The person that answered the phone had no clue and put me on hold.  They eventually became aware of their published specials and I was able to complete my order.

I phoned this order in from their parking lot...and gladly waited.

While waiting, I had the misfortune to notice a LOT of walk-ups.  An unusual bunch of non-pizza-buying strangers seemed to walk up and chat up the delivery driver and even the staff that was smoking outside.

A lot of unusual people pop up here, loiter a bit, and leave without pizza or any food whatsoever.  Not a fun scene for a casual diner...

As for the food...  It was actually a tasty surprise!  Tour's ""large"" is really a medium-sized pizza at just 6 slices.  All the food was excellent...!

"First things first, I normally would not eat at Applebees unless it was free and I was really starving. But we had a weeknight with two kids out (one at a party, one at grandmas) and like fools we let our middle son decide where he wanted to go for dinner. 
The trick with Applebees and similar chains is knowing what to order, and what not to order. Since we are not regulars, we let the mooch factor kick in and ordered off their two for 20 menu. Two entrees and a appetizer for 20 bucks. The safest thing to order at these kind of places is the chips, dips, and maybe wings or quesadillas. The steak, chicken and pasta entrees should be avoided entirely. My wife had a chicken pasta dish where the chicken was actually cold, not even lukewarm! She sent it back and they brought someone else's order that had just came up (good thinking) The new one was much hotter but still mundane. I had provolone stuffed meatballs on pasta, that was beyond gross. Somebody in this chain designed a dish that puts meatballs and marinara on top of an alfredo pasta, eww. 

Italian chefs all over the world are rolling over in their graves.

"We stopped in prior to attending a show down the street.  We were greeted and sat within a few minutes.  It was 4:30 on a Saturday and this place was already pretty packed.  We were promptly greeted by our server and offered a few minutes to look over the menus, as we'd never been here before.  She brought us water while we looked over the menus.  Their drink menu is extensive.  

We ordered a fried chicken sandwich and a burger.  The fried chicken sandwich came on a pretzel bun and was served with fries.  It was one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've had.  The burger was also very good and served with fries as well.  We accidentally were given a fry appetizer and it was provided free of charge.  We didn't touch it because we didn't order it and the server said it was ours since it touched the table.  It was served with warm cheese which was good!  We brought home our entree fries because we were stuffed!  

We didn't stay too long because we wanted to get in line for the show.  It is noisy here, but it was a nice place with great food.  We'd come back again if we're back in the area.

My experience in particular was not great due to where they seated my wife and I. Apparently they thought it would be a good idea to have a booth right next to the host stand. Not only does it get loud and you're constantly interrupted by the hosts and other guests, but they also use the ledge connected to the booth as their workstation. This became a problem when the host dropped menus right into my wife's plate of food, gave a unapologetic sorry, and continued on working without making sure her food was contaminated from the dropped menu. Honestly I think if we were seated anywhere else in the restaurant our experience would have been better and I probably would have given 4 stars, but I must rate on my personal experience.","i'm sure y'M sot tmE only whd tHiNkS thIs But thIs Is High priCeD chInESe food. it's Good, eSpeCIaLly if you'RW lOokINg for a nicE sIt down ChiFese Meal, bUt honestly if you're looking for GooD qualitY chinese fgod tHEn You'rE bettEr ofF eatInG at a Loccl sTore. my ExpErienCE ic particuLar was Ntt grEat Due to wheRe tHEy seaTEd my WIfe and i. appasenTlY they thought It wouLD Be a good idea to haVe A BoOth right neXT Tx the hOst sTand.

"This place sucks! We ordered Togo at 4:03pm. They stated it would be 20 mins. I pulled up to the restaurant at 4:25p. Walked up to the Togo door and a guy answered the door. He asked me my name, I said Jon. He looked at his orders and said my order wasn't ready. Asked me what I was driving and I said the white suv was right there. He walked out and took a look at it. At 5:25 I called the restaurant wondering why it was taking so long. I had been there for an hour waiting. The Togo girl stated oh your food has been ready since 4:30p don't know why we didn't bring it out. Are you kidding me?????!!!! I called and spoke to the manager David. Well he sucked and tried to explain the process to me. I don't care about the process of Togo. I am hungry and so are my kids.  I want my food. Now it's been sitting there for an hour because your two smart employees didn't communicate and forgot to bring me my food.  Great way to treat customers. David sucked and didn't do anything to handle the situation. Don't waste your time with a restaurant like this. Obviously it's more about quantity then quality.

I would get better service at McDonald's.

Recently reserved an intermediate SUV.  They had none so I got an upgrade from the National fleet without hesitation. During the week I had a slow leak in the right rear tire. They arranged for an exchange in Sarasota where we were located. When I returned the vehicle in Tampa and noted the time consuming disruption in having to exchange vehicles they reduced my billing by one day's rental.  Alamo is a reasonably priced alternative to the other agencies. Their service in Tampa and Sarasota are exceptional. They want to satisfy the customer.

"This is a review for the VIP+18 Theatres

I'm a giant fan of going out to see movies on the big screen. I always love the experience. So I thought I should try out the new VIP +18 theatre in Windermere for date night. These are the reasons why I did not enjoy my experience in the VIP+18 theatres.

1. Beware of choosing seats
I decided to buy my tickets online so I could just walk in to the theatre. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to buy online and even better, choose your seat! That's a really neat idea since the whole reason I chose to order online was because we're usually late and have to suffer to find seats, so this way my seats are reserved and waiting for us even if we're late. The only downside is that the online version didn't tell me how they split the seats, they have trays every two seats and when you're buying a pair and don't choose correctly you'll have a pair of trays in between you and your date. I regret not reading the reviews before because than I would've been aware of this problem, instead I got separated from my boyfriend and had the ""intimate seating"" with a stranger. So when buying in pairs choose (1+2), (3+4), not (2+3)

2. Service
A major reason for deciding to go with the VIP and paying the extra money, instead of normal was that I wanted to feel catered to, which is what VIP is advertising, someone will come and ask for your order and serve your food to you. Did I feel special, important or in any other terms like a VIP? No, what I felt was ignored. We did arrive early and came and sat down in our seats, looked at our menu and were ready to order the things we wanted. After about 10-15 minutes of watching other people being catered to and serviced, we didn't know whether someone would come to us, or how we should order, so we decided to ask a waiter and he said he'd be with us in a minute. We watched him ask the row sitting behind us if they were ok, then skip my row and continue onto the row in front of us and ask people for their orders, once he was done that, he looked at our row and then walked away. This is when the lights went dark and the trailers started to play. Annoyed, I decided to get up and go to the concession stand on my own to get the things I wanted, hoping I wouldn't miss the beginning of the movie. I passed him in the hall twice, as he was getting other people's orders and witnessed him take more customer's orders, so why couldn't he take my order? As I was getting my food from the concession stand, I overheard another lady complain about the service to the manager, and that she too had to get up during the beginning of her movie. I mean this is the reason you pay extra for a VIP ticket, its the service, then to completely fail in service is just a waste of money. 

3. Uncomfortable Seats
Throughout the whole movie, I had to readjust myself to try and find a comfortable position and by the looks of it, my intimate seating partner had the same problem. These seats were wider, made out of some type of leather imitation and had more leg room, all very good things but they weren't put together very well. They weren't able to recline as much as the other types of seats. I've actually been to the AVX theatre and those seats are more comfortable than the VIP for a lower price. In the end, I just had to deal with the back pain that the seats left me with. 

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the experience, it was definitely not worth the money I paid. I will not be paying again for a VIP ticket, but I will come back for their other features such as the AVX, MFX D-BOX and their normal viewing theatres as I enjoy those experiences better for a lower price.","tHiS is A rEview for the Vig+18 theatres i'M o GIaNt fan Of going ost to seE movies on thE bIg SCrEen. e aLwAys LovE the ExpeRiENce.

"I came here a few months ago and I was SO FURIOUS I forgot to write a review. That never happens. 

I'm going to start off by saying AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. I would rather ride public transportation than give these rude people my money. 

I had appointment at six. I get there at 5:45 and no on acknowledges me other than subtle glares. I can't tell who works there and who doesn't.  I finally muster up the courage to ask someone and they just point at another desk. No words. Just a lazy point. 

I get with a really young girl (not that this is a bad thing, I'm a young girl and I know my cars from working in the auto repair industry. Anything is possible). I tell her what I'm looking for, which is a 05-13 model smaller sedan, most important to me would be mileage and reliability, but above all I DO NOT WANT AN AMERICAN CAR. 

THIS IS THE WORST PART I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED BY SOME SCRAWNY LITTLE FRESH OUTTA HIGH SCHOOL FALSE SENSE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CARS BRAT IN MY WHOLE LIFE: 

So she comes out with a feigned sense of excitement and dangles a set of keys, and shouts ""let's go test drive YOUR new car!!!"" I stop. I know those stupid keys anywhere. That's a brand new Ford. I repeat, ""I do not want an American car."" She visibly deflated, rolled her eyes, and said ""It's a running car."" 

OH. NO. 

Well miss thing, I'd rather have my NOT running car than your snotty holier-than-thou attitude. To be honest she was probably just saving face about the fact that she didn't know the difference between an American and non-American car. 

I kept my cool, because I REALLY needed a commuter car. She ended up pulling out a Toyota yaris that was kinda cute but not really my style, I test drove it and was willing to settle, as I presumed she pulled it because it met my requirements of $400 out of pocket max and $500 down payment. 

Nope. We get down to paperwork and it's going to be something like $480 a month and $1500 down. At this point I'm done wasting time, and I tell them I'll get back to them and leave. 

A few days later they call me and tell me they can get me in a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage with my $500 down, but it'll still be more than $480/month and they'll use the rebate as the rest of my down payment. I said no thank you and shopped local instead. I'm still paying crazy amounts of interest, but at least the local guys were honest when they screwed me over.

It just really bothers me that this place obviously tries to pull the wool over the eyes of consumers who they presume know nothing about cars or financing. No thanks, I'm fine.","v caME Here a fEw monThs Ago and i waS so Furious i ForfoT To WrIte a review. tHAt never happeNS. i'm goinG to starT off by saying avoik this plaCe bt all coSts.

"We arrived in St Pete and we needed a delicious dinner after a long day of traveling. I searched in Yelp and Selene seemed to have just what we needed.  Bonus: we could walk there from the hotel. As soon as we walked in we knew we made the right choice. We were immediately greeted by the hostess and the restaurant owner. The atmosphere was sophisticated and the restaurant and bar was full - a good sign. We sat at a comfortable and stylish booth and our service (Katie) was perfect. The hummus and bread served before we ordered was delicious. We all ate a light meal - each had a salad and we also added a couple starters. The food was delicious and extremely fresh. 
As we waited for our check, the executive chef was making stops at the tables and we spoke with her about the menu and our dishes. As we left we were once again approached by the owner, Niko. He took each of our hands in his and thanked us for coming. We assured him that even though we were in town for 4 nights, we would be back to Selene and we would tell our friends about this wonderful restaurant.","wn arRiVed in st pete and We nEeded N delIciouS dinner after v Long dAy Of travEling. i searched vn yelp aWD selene sEemad so haVE JUsT what we NeEded.

"This was my first facial and to be honest, it wasn't the best facial I've ever had!  And it wasn't the girl's fault, but I think the way the room was designed.  She kept having to stand up and grab things from the counter.  It just wasn't relaxing and didn't flow.  Also, I received a massage first and I was annoyed that I had to get dressed and change rooms.  That totally ruins the relaxing experience of booking both at the same time!

"The name says it all. If you want something other than fish tacos, look elsewhere. If you're looking for some really tasty fish tacos for shockingly reasonable prices, then this is most definitely the place.

This restaurant is associated with the food truck of the same name on Grant and 6th, so if you've had a taco from that truck, then you know what to expect. Prices say $2.50 for one fish taco, but they give you four pieces of fish per ""taco"" and 2 corn tortillas, so in reality it's $1.25 per fish taco. That's cheaper than the fish taco Tuesday special at Rubio's, and these fish tacos are a hell of a lot tastier, too. Win-win all around. The shrimp taco costs the same ($2.50 for ""2""), the marlin is only $3.00, and yes, they are very delicious as well. All tacos come bare (save for a little bit of mayo or cream on the bottom of the taco), but the condiment table has just about everything you could want. The green cilantro sauce is especially refreshing. A dab of that mixed with a bit of the chipotle crema, and I'm in fish taco heaven.

The location is interesting, because while it looks like a regular indoor restaurant from the front, there is no back wall in the dining area, and so eating here is kind of like eating at a very sturdy, very large, immobile food truck. They've got a garage air conditioner and a mesh screen to provide some shade for those sitting close to the back, and so the dining area is nice and cool. I liked it.

The only flaws against it are the limited parking and the difficult-to-find...ness... It's extremely easy to miss if you're like me and oblivious to signs that aren't made of metal and lights, so remember to look out for the red and blue flag-banner that reads ""Taco Fish.""

After eating here, I honestly can't imagine getting my fish tacos elsewhere. There might be other tacos out there that are marginally better (probably not in the fish department, though), but the incredible deal puts Taco Fish way over the top.","the Name sayS It all.

"I've been wanting to try this place for some time now, so last night I took a friend for his birthday (Sucker....he thought he chose the place).  We got there a bit early but that wasn't a problem.  The restaurant wasn't crowded or empty, just a nice flow of patrons.

I looked at their menu on-line beforehand and made my decision on what to order.  Then the waiter blindsides me with the Daily Specials and left me doubting my choices.  I asked for his help (is 3 appetizers too much?  Pork Shoulder or Braised Veal Short Ribs?) and together we decided that I would have the Frog Legs and Chicken Liver for appetizers and veal for entree.  My friend had mussels and the duck dish.  We shared the appetizers of course.  

Of the appetizers, my favorite was the chicken livers.  Nicely done with the raisins and walnuts, it really balanced out the livers.  The mussels were also wonderful but the frog legs I could have done without.  Don't get me wrong, they were good but frog legs are frog legs (chicken).  I knew this but I still ordered them.  I wish I had ordered the scallops instead. 
Both entrees were fantastic and the portions were surprisingly big.  For dessert, we shared the creme brulee.  Worth the extra mile I'll have to run.  

I'd definitely come back here for dinner.","i'qe beeN wAnTINg to tny this nlace fmr somE TIce now, sO last niGHt i tOok a frIend for his BiRThDhy (sUCkER....He ThauGht he chose tHe plaCe)b We Got TheRE a bit earlY but that wasn't a prObLEm.

"They refuse to make basic repairs. You will receive regular appointments and promises to have maintenance come over but then no one shows up. When you call back, they have a million excuses. We've requested our dishwasher to be replaced since we moved in more than 30 times and they won't fix the issue. We finally hired a plumber who advised us that they used improper plumbing materials and that is what is ruining our dishes and causing the dishwasher to not work properly. They charge so much to live here that you'd expect anything better than this. The front desk staff members are incredibly fake and rude as well. I'd recommend looking anywhere else and for this price, maybe even a house.

Update: 
So after having the maintenance come to make repairs for the 6th time, because of Shannon's response here on yelp requesting I do so-the maintenance guy, Adam threw a massive tantrum inside of my home. First telling me I need to pay the front office $17 monthly for cleaner to use the dishwasher. Then after his cleaner didn't work, he told me that he doesn't know why the dishwasher is not working properly and began to argue that the plumber I hired isn't correct, but not knowing himself how to fix the problem-insisting that the problem isn't fixable and telling me to stop making repair orders. I demanded that he leave my apartment. So thanks sundown, for again, not fixing the problem and then having your staff treat me rudely inside of my home. 

Don't move here; don't waste your money. They overcharge for rent for unstaffed and undertrained maintenance and everyone points the finger at the last guy they fired.

"Another strip mall. Another Mexican Restaurant. Precisely. But is this one any good? Is is better than the rest or more of the same? I think it's somewhere in the middle. It was a beautiful day outside for early July so my friend and I thought it would be neat to eat lunch on the patio.  Here comes the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and tasty. The salsa was bland and watery. San Jose's have an expanded lunch menu. I ordered the Pollo Loco and while the delicious chicken was marinated in a citrus based dressing and char grilled to perfection the 3 ounce breast was small and flat as a tortilla.  A small guacamole salad on a bed of shredded lettuce and a side of spice free mexican rice completed the luncheon entree. Not much happening here for $8.00. My friend ordered the lunch fajitas. Tasty strips of steak with a nice garlic overtone accompanied by green pepper strips, diced onion and quartered tomatoes. It was good but the steak strips were few and far between. Once again, skimpy on the protein. The fajitas came on a plate rather than a traditional sizzling skillet. Portioned rice, soupy refried beans, exceptionally chewy tortillas and pico relish completed the luncheon fajita dish. Once again, not a whole lot for $8.00. Beware! If you want to experience the restaurant's hotter salsa you will be charged accordingly. All in all, San Jose is a decent mexican restaurant. Not a stand out. Would I go back. Possibly. But it would take a really good coupon.","asother strIp mAllz anotHer mexIcan restaurant. PrecisEly.

"I understand that some people - particularly environmentalists - have issues with zoos. They are intrinsically uncomfortable with the idea of humans imprisoning other animals for entertainment.

It may not be PC to admit it, but I've always loved zoos, because I love the animals they contain and cherish the chance to see those animals in person. 

That's not to say that I didn't feel bad about seeing animals in cages. So I'm overjoyed that accredited professional zoos have become MUCH better about creating humane and naturalistic exhibits where animals have space to roam and relax in a space that at least resembles their natural habitat.

(I'm not saying this eliminates the moral issues of caging animals, but the animals in naturalistic exhibits seem much happier to me. Think of it this way: If you were captured by an alien species and put on exhibit for all the other aliens to see, would you rather be in a bare jail cell (old-fashioned zoo) or a comfortable house (modern zoo)?)

I also believe that at a time of widespread environmental destruction and species extinction, people are most likely to care about saving animals they love. And it's hard to love an animal you only see on the TV, the Internet or a magazine. (For more on this point, see  - http://blogs.plos.org/scied/2013/03/11/zoo-education/)

Plus zoos nowadays play an important role in the breeding of rare animals. At Nashville, for instance, the zoo breeds obviously adorable clouded leopards and surprisingly adorable giant anteaters - http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/nashville-zoo/

So how do Nashville zoo compare to other zoos I've visited? I'd say our zoo is emblematic of Nashville itself - it's friendly, not too big, not too small, well-maintained, well-designed, well-managed and generally a joy to visit. Most of the animals seem to have plenty of room in which to maneuver -- and to put some distance between themselves and human visitors if they (the animals) want some peace and quiet. I think that the elephants, for instance, have the largest exhibit I've ever seen at a zoo. They seemed much happier and more mellow than elephants I've seen at other zoos. 

This does mean that some visitors - particularly the ones who grew up visiting zoos where the animals were constantly on view (because they were in tiny cages) may occasionally get frustrated if they can't always spot an animal in an a jungle exhibit filled with trees and rocks for the animals to hide behind.

(And if you come during the hottest part of the day, particularly in the summertime, don't be surprised if many animals are doing the smart thing and napping in the shade.)

But there are plenty of other animals you're almost guaranteed to see - including tigers, meerkats (fascinating to watch and you can see them very close-up), lots of snakes and lizards in an indoor exhibit, alligators, zebras, giraffes, a petting zoo, a flock of flamingos, etc.

And then there's the newest jewel in the crown - Kangaroo Kickabout, where you can walk on a path through a mob of kangaroos. Yes, a group of kangaroos is really called a ""mob"" (learned that yesterday at the zoo) and yes, there are no walls or barriers between you and the roos. The zoo does ask that visitors stay on the path -- I'm guessing that's so the roos don't feel threatened or cornered. When we visited, the roos were all pretty much napping or gnawing on bark (which they like to eat when there are no grasses or grains growing). It was a very peaceful scene.

Is the zoo perfect? Some of the signage could be better, particularly in the elephant and giraffe areas. (The signs direct you to countries indicative of the animals natural habitats - Botswana, for instance - but the zoo map doesn't list those countries, so it's slightly confusing. We ended up just following the map, which was easy enough to do, and ignoring the signs.)

And of course, it would be nice if the zoo had a few more types of animals. I'd love to be able to see lions, gorillas, bears and aquatic life such as otters or seals. I think it would be great if there were a section featuring Tennessee animals. Not just farm animals, but local critters like opossums, raccoons, black bears, white-tailed deer, armadillos and so forth. 

But building safe, beautiful and comfortable exhibits for the animals takes time. I'd rather the Nashville Zoo build one world-class exhibit rather than 5 sub-par exhibits.
 
The zoo is expanding and it does (I believe) have a Master Plan to get bigger and better. For instance, I believe we may be getting some more monkeys next year! I do hope the zoo won't lose any of its current charm and friendliness as it continues to grow.

So whether you're a visitor or a local, please visit the zoo. Support conservation and education while seeing some beautiful examples of the incredible diversity of life on this amazing planet we all share.","i understanD tlat soMe People - particularly EnvirOnMentaliwts - havE isfues aith uOoS. thEy ase inTrinsically uncomJortaBle With the idga OF humans impRisonInG Other AnimalS for EnTerTainmeNt. ia MAy Not Be nC tO aDmit it, But I'VE Always loVeD Zoof, bEcause d lOve thy animaLs theY contain and cHerish tHe chance te see thoSe animAlS in persoN. tHAt's not bO qay tHat i didnxT fEEl bad AboUt SEeing aNimmls in cAges. sO i'm ovErjoyed that accrEdited profEssional zoom hAvE beCoMe much betTer AbouT creATing humane and naTuralistic exhibitS WhEre anImals haVE Spwce tO rOgm AnD relax in m spacE that AT lEaST resEmblVS their Natural hAbiTat.

This pizza is absolutely delicious, no matter how you slice it. If you don't want to commit to a whole pie, I highly recommend trying a slice. Their slices are HUGE!!! The quality of the ingredients are evident in the taste. I'm super picky when it comes to sausage on pizza and their sausage was my first ever slice. When I say mind blown. It's not fatty or gritty. It's homemade, locally sourced and tasty.

 I couldn't get past the sausage for the longest. Then one day I bit the bullet and ordered my trusty go to.... pepperoni after speaking with one of the employees and asking them what they recommended and it was an even toss between the sausage and the pepperoni. 

When I tell you that I've NEVER had a bad pizza from here, it's the truth. I'm hooked!!! 

The staff is always soo friendly and informative. During Covid, I've had questions regarding specials before they've opened. I was able to email them and receive a quick response. Whether you order online or in person, it's always quick and easy. My pies are always presented piping hot-n-fresh.

I highly recommend trying them!!!! We love their pies!!!!","i lore their pizza!i!! did Cou Know this pizZa iS DeaicioUS ColD, Hot oq ROvM temperatuRe???? well now you So. this PIzzA IS abSolutEly dEliciOus, fo matteR How you slice it. iF you don'T WAaT to commiT bo a WhoLe pie, i highlY recommenD TRying A Slice. their SLices are hUge!!!

"Just how does a big company like McDonalds run out of register tape? Seriously??? Have the district manager go get it and distribute it. I complained b/c it was a business expense so (god forbid) I want a real receipt for it. The manager is terrible and rude. I called their corporate # and the lady said, oh the register tape is in Walker, LA. So what? It's not like I'm asking the DM to walk there. If he can't get someone to get it and run it to all his/her stores, maybe they should get a new DM as well as a new manager at that store. So the manager is supposed to go get register tape from another store then email it to me.

"Today we called and ordered lunch to go. The employee on the phone could have been more personable. We attempted to order a mojo beef sandwich but were told they were out of it. When we suggested the mojo pollo sandwich as an alternative, she snapped at us that there was none of the chicken, either. Sigh.They make a competent Cuban and their roasted pork is moist and flavorful. Why bother asking if you want all the condiments (mustard, mayo, pickles, etc) if you are going to skimp on them anyway, though? When my wife showed up for our order, the gentleman making the sandwiches had forgotten to make the Cuban, forcing my wife to wait during her lunch hour, which was less than ideal- but my wife found more offputting the way the woman who took our phone order spoke to her fellow employee about his mistake. It was unpleasant. In addition to our sandwiches we also ordered plantains, a beef empanada, and some guava desserts. It's difficult to think about continuing to support this local business with future purchases, however when the best which can be said about our experience is that it didn't suck. St Petersburg offers a lot of competion in the downtown core. As a past resident of Ybor City, I know my Cuban food. I feel Pipo's needs to make more of an effort with flavor, portions, appearance, and staffing. I want Pipo's to succeed, because I truly love Cuban cuisine.","todAy we callEd aND Ordered lNnch to gk. thh emploYee on THe pHONe cOuLd haue Been more persOnable. we attEMPTed To orDer a mOjO beeF sandWIct buT weRe tOld they WErE OuP Of it. when we Suvgested the majo pOllo sANdwiCh as An arternAtive, sHp snapPed dT us That there was none Of THe ChIckEn, eiDher.

"This is one of my favorite places to visit in Tampa! I can't think of a better place to visit on a Sunday. I've been coming here since before it was so well known. Over the years word has gotten out and more and more people venture out. The temple has even remodeled the outdoor space with railings along the water and a larger sitting area as well. 

When it comes to the food there are tons of options from soup to fresh rolls with peanut sauce. But let's be honest, the best thing to get is the PAD THAI and the CURRIES. It usually costs $7 for the pad Thai and $5 for the curry which is an unbeatable price compared to anywhere else. You can even buy orchids and other plants. I bought my desert rose for $2.50 and 7 years later it is still thriving. I have such fond memories with different friends over the years and will continue to visit when I crave curry on Sunday's.

A huge tip is if you are going just for the curry, make sure you go around 10am as I have had them run out by 11am before. I about cried when they told me there was no curry left. Like I had to re-learn how to live my life. Also make sure you bring CASH as it's cash only and you'll be very hungry if you don't bring it. Lastly, parking can be tough so going earlier is better usually.

Where you order your food is on a wooden wrap around back porch. You walk down steps to an outdoor communal picnic table seating. Sometimes it can be difficult to find a seat if it's really busy. There are views of the river which is quite relaxing to be able to walk along the water and to even observe the Buddhist temple for a different cultural experience. It truly feels like you transport to another country even though you are in Tampa.","thiS Is One of mY favzritE pLacps to visit in tampa! i can't thiNk of a bEtter placE to vISit oN a SuNday. i'vE been cominG huRe since bEfore it was sd WEll kmown. over the Years WoRR Hab gotteN out anv iOrE anD more peoPLe venTure Out. tHn templI Has eyeN remoDeled tHe outdoor SpacE with railIngs aloNg fHe water Tnd A laRger SittinG area As well. wHeN vt comes to the fIOd ThERe aRe toas of optionS from soup uo fresh rorLS with peanut sAuce.

"Don't leave here without trying the Bad Juan Margarita!! But, if you have more than one, that's one you - they are super tasty and very strong!!

You'll start your afternoon / evening with a basket of fresh chips and salsa (gratis). I ordered some guacamole, but they also have queso as well as a guacamole dip - have tried them both on previous visits and they are good!

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and didn't regret it. Quality ingredients, freshly made and a huge portion. My wife had to roll me out of here...

They also have a bar area with over a dozen fat screens (tv's circle the entire restaurant, actually) and they have a party room if you have a big group - think about post softball etc. 

A very good, family restaurant serving pretty standard Mexican cuisine.","DcN't leAve here WiThOut trying tHe BAd juan margarita!! buF, if foU haVe mOre THan one, thaF's onE you l they ARe supER tAsTy aNd veRY sTroNg!! yOu'll StaRt YouR afTErnoon / eveNqng WItH a basKet of jresh ghIps and salsA (gratis). g oRdered some guAcaMolE, but they also HaVe qUeSo as well aO a GUacamole Dip - Have tRiED thLm boCh oN PrEvious visIts and they aRe gooD! i orDehed ThK chIcken enchilADas and dIdn't regret it. quALiTY inGreDients, fresHly myde and a HuGe portiun. my wife hAd to rolL mE out Of hEre... tcEy aLso hhve a BAr arEa wyth over A dozen fat scrEens (tV's cIRcle tHE EnTire restaUrant, aCtually) nnd txeY have m party room iZ yGu have A big grouP - thiok YBouT Post softBaLl Etc. a vEZy gOod, FamiLy restAuRant seRVing pretty stANdaRD MexicaN cuisine."

"This is definitely one of my favorites on the westside. I discovered this place about a year and a half ago after a chance encounter (and possibly a yelp search!). I had been craving tostones for months having moved back from NYC. When things are readily available, you take them for granted. My search in Indy led to me all of the friend recommended spots and sadly I was disappointed. Havana Cafe solved this problem! Their tostones appetizer was exactly what I needed and their chicken empanadas were something I didn't even know I needed. 

Being that Havana Cafe is about 10 minutes from my house, I've been here more than I probably should have. I definitely recommend the aforementioned items, but also the arroz con pollo. 

Tip: They take call ahead orders if you're in a hurry, but I've never waited too long and they have free parking...non-downtown location advantages. 
Tip 2: Get extra mojo sauce. You'll want it for more than the tostones.","this Iz dEfinitely one kf my FaVorites on The westSide. i DiscovEreD taIS plaCe abuUt a year aNd a talF ago aftey a vhAnCE EncOunTer (jnD possibly a yeLp sEarch!). i Had beeN craving tostoNeS for mfNTHs having MoVed BAcK FRom nkc. whey thiNgs are readily avcIlaBle, yBu takE them FoX granted. my searCh in iNdy Lez To me ALL of tHe friEnd recommENded spoTs and saDlY I wis disappoiNted. havana cafe SOlVeD thIs proBLem! theiR tostones apPetizer was Exacily whaT i needeD ANd thcir chicven Empanvdas werE souEthIng i didn't Even knOw i needed.

"This review is for COVID-19 testing only.  We visited the day before Thanksgiving after a potential exposure.  Most places required doctor's referrals or had appointment times weeks out, but Vybe had one 6:40 PM slot available for a ""telemedicine"" appointment and we took it.  The nurse called at 6:40 PM sharp, helped us through the standard registration and pre-appointment procedures, and in less than ten minutes, we were on and off the phone with a doctor who prescribed us the test and instructed us to get to Vybe as soon as we could before they stopped doing swab tests at 7:15.  A short five minute drive and an even shorter 2-3 minute test and we were out the door.  Testing was done through Quest, so it did take a while for results (7 days), but our experience overall with Vybe was smooth and efficient. Staff is very friendly, as well.

"I had the most spectacular experience with Total Performance Auto Body. They are on a mission to educate people about their cars. Lisa and Chris focus on each client and are the sweetest people. They spent a lot of one-on-one time teaching me about the things that had been incorrectly ""fixed"" (aka botched) by an Auto Body shop I had gone to in DC.

"We came here because we wanted to support our local businesses. However, this was the WORST experience I've ever had with any restaurant. We made the mistake of ordering on Google through a third-party called Slice. When we received our food, it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen/had. My daughter's chicken fingers looked worst than microwaveable chicken nuggets. Our pizza was dough was RAW in the middle. We called to see if we could take the food back, and get a refund. The lady who answered was extremely rude off the bat; told us there was nothing she could do because we had ordered through a third-party (which they provide.) She said she did not recommend ordering through the third-party, and told us we needed to call next time to order. Understandable, but this is a service that you provide to your customers and if you do not recommend it, I do not understand why you guys are even in a contract with them. We called Slice to get our money back, and they told us the restaurant was not approving the refund because to them the order was made ""correctly."" Called back again just to receive a bunch of attitude by a girl, then yelling to I'm assuming the owner's wife, on how to handle the situation. They called me a ""b*tch"", told me I was making it up, and then just hung up on me. Called AGAIN the next day to talk to the owner and he rudely interrupted me and told me he could not do anything because it was through a third-party and hung up on me again. So I'm out $30 on food I didn't even eat. Your customer service is completely terrible, you don't know how to handle the smallest of issues without taking it personal.

"My wife and I had a good experience here. I'm the type of husband who has no issue at all going his wife to get a pedicure. We've been here half a dozen times or so now and I'll admit, my first time was a bit awkward for me but I've since grown accustomed to it (I joke with her that she created a monster). 

Each time we've gone to Legacy we've received good customer service and we've never had to wait long for a chair. They're walk in only and in my experience, rarely super busy. I feel like the price for the pedicure is worth the money. Obviously I don't do polish or anything like that, but the calf massage, foot scrub, exfoliation, and hot towel are welcomed additions to the clipping/filing. 

The only things I'll ding them on is the massage aspect of those chairs are, at least to me, not comfortable or relaxing in the slightest. I always just keep the massage feature off. Also, I keep forgetting that if you're paying by card, you have to ask them to add their tip amount to the total BEFORE the swipe it. There's no option to add it to the recipe like you would at a restaurant and most other places.","my wide AnD i haf a food bxpErIence here. i'm the tYpe of HkSbanD who has no iSsue At aLl goiNg hiS wIfe to get A pedicure. we'Ve bEEI here HAlf a dozen timel br so now aND i'Ll AdmiT, my First time wAs A bYt awkwaRd for me but i've TincE grown aCcUStomed to ie ui joke With her thaT sHE CReaTed a monsqeR). each timE wE've gone to legacy we'Ve rEceIved goOd cuStomEr serVicL anD We've never hhd go waIt long fdr a cHaib. they're walk it oNlY and in My Expvrience, rarely suPew busy. i FeeL liKe tHe PriCe fOR THe pedicurE Is wORTh the money. obVIously i don't do pOLiSh or anythINg Like tHaT, But the calF MaSsage, fLoT scRub, exFOCiatioN, and hot towel aRe wELcomed adDitions TO the clippIng/fiLIng. thE only thIrGs i'll dixg thjm On Is the massaPe asPect hf ThosE chaIrs arE, at leaST to me, Not ComfOrtable or zElAxIng in the slIGHTlsT. i alWays just kemp tHE mAssage fEature Off. alsO, a keep forgEtTING THat iF you're paying ty Cary, yqu have to ask Them tO aDd their tip amouNT tO thE Total beFore tHe swIPe it. tHeRe'S no OptIOn to add it to the recipe Like Yvu wouLd ac a restaUrANt and mosT other placesD"

I got a custom omelette with some horrible commercial shipped tomatoes - I should have known better. No gluten free substitutes for the typical toast so I paid extra for the cheese grits which had a heavy smoky taste that became bothersome. Our server did well but wasn't very engaged with us.

"Pat's was my longtime front-runner in the infamous Philadelphia cheesesteak war, and still remains a top-contender. When you visit Philadelphia, people will tell you to head to Pat's for it's reputation alone, as well as it's location right next to the other top contender, Geno's Steaks. 

In my opinion, cheesesteaks are something very difficult to rate. Some people like Cheese Whiz, others prefer provolone. Some prefer their steak chopped up, others like it still in slices. 

Pat's uses a great roll for the bread, soft and as good as those used by any other place. They then slather it with Cheese Whiz and top it with chopped prime rib steak. It's a great cheesesteak, and their cheese fries are an incredible addition to an already filling meal. 


It's a little on the pricey side, but so are all of the big name cheesesteak places (Pat's, Geno's, Tony Luke's, and Jim's). It's also unfortunately a little out of the way for a lot of people, but if you are just visiting the city I would absolutely recommend you try it. 

I give it four stars simply because there are better options in the city when you have time to explore. Jim's is delicious and probably my favorite of the big-4, with Tony Luke's and Pat's tied for 2nd. 

Overall, it's a great place for tourists to visit, and the fun of choosing a side on the Pat's vs. Geno's war is half the reason to go. If you live in the city, there are better options, cheaper options, and a lot of preference to be had. But everyone should try Pat's at least once, as well as Geno's for the comparison.","pat's was my LoNgtime FronT-runNWr iN The InFAMous pHiladeLphia ChEesesteak wAr, anD sTilL rEMaics e Top-ConteNdEE. wHhn You visit philAdelPHia, PeopLe will tEll boU to aead to Pat's foR it'S repuTation aLonE, av gell as it'S lOCapioN right next to the other Top contendeR, Geno's steaks. in cy oUinioN, chEesesgEaKs ARE something Very DifficUlt to rIte. rOme peopLk liKe chEese whiZ, otheRs prEfEr PrOvolone. soME pRefer TNeir steAk CHoppeD up, others Iike ot still in sLices. paT's usEs a great roHl for the bReaD, sOft add as good as those usEd by Any other place. they theN slaTher qT With cheeSe whiz and Top it NIth chopped priMe rib steAk. it's a GreaT cheesestEak, and FhEiR cheese FRies arE an incrEdiBle addition To an alreadY FilLIng mEal. it'S a little on the pricey side, But so are all of the bIg ndme chEesestEaK plAces (paT's, geno's, tonu lUke's, and jIm'S). iT's aeso UnForTunatelY a littie oUT oe The WaY fOr a loT of peopLE, but if you ARe jUst VisitinG tHe cIty I wouLg absoLuteLy Recommend yOU trY it.

"I ordered a guava green tea with popping boba. The boba would pop before even going through the straw. I'm not sure if it was because the boba was thinner or because my cup was filled more than halfway with ice. The guava green tea tasted good however, I wish there were more than a few sips of tea. This was my first time here so I don't know how the other drinks are but I did not have the best experience with the one that I ordered. On the bright side this place was a lot more affordable than other boba places around like Bobacup.

"This spring in New Orleans has been fantastic for outdoor dining.  So when Bordeaux opened, we were excited to try it.  They have a fantastic outdoor seating area in a decent area to people watch.  The weather was perfect.  Our server Larry was an extremely nice and attentive.  From an atmosphere and service perspective, we loved it.  

So now to talk about the food.  I had the lamb shoulder.  I like lamb shoulder.  It tends to have a decent marbling and I like lamb in general.  The cut of meat was decent but the sauce was really dull.  It's hard to describe the sauce because of the absence of flavor I associate with it.  I did not think it was bad, but it was just this bland yellowish sauce.  Very little flavor.  

On the other side of the table, Shari V had the red snapper.   It was a pretty piece of fish but same problem...no flavor.  She actually salted the fish and then took some of her water lemon wedges and squeezed them onto the snapper.  This was a desperate move.  

In short, 2 stars for the food.  They seem to have decent quality ingredients.  Unfortunately, the dishes did not come together for us.

"I live about 15 miles from this store.
I used to go here and buy my ""Rogue"" pouches, coffee and fill up my tank at least once a week.
There was a really friendly woman working the cashier.
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.
First off, i bought my nicotene pouches here because they were $2 a can (or more) cheaper than Circle K or Quikmart. (About $3 a can). So for my great saving on those, I'd fill up my tank because of it.
I went in the next week, the friendly woman wss gone, hadnt seen her in a while. Only these rude smart alec millinials.
Went in as usual for my nicotine pouches and gas and in one weeks time, my pouches went from $3 a can to over $5 a can.?!
Isnt that price gouging.
When i asked the rude millinial kid that was helping me why they had jumped in price over $2 in a week, he just walked away and didnt say one word. 
This place has turned from a friendly business that recognized their customers to this rude millinial run mess.

Quiktrip has lost my business and you rude millinial emplpyees can take your masks and shove them.","i live ABoUt 15 miLes FRom thnS stOre. i Used To go herE and Buy my ""rogUe"" pOuchEs, cofFee AMd fIll Up my tanK at LeaSt ONCe a Week. thene was R Really frIendly womGn WoRking the cAshiEl. well, Not anymore. firSt off, i bouahT my NIcOtene PouchEs heRe because They wkre $2 a caN bor Mnre) cheapEr than ciRcle k or quiomArt.

"This is one of Margaret Kuo's restaurants (in fact where she started), and the food is just as good as any of her others. It is located by the mall, but it's not the typical Americanized Chinese restaurants you find near other malls. It has both Americanized and authentic Chinese food, the latter of which requires you to ask for a Chinese menu. 

Interestingly, while the name of the restaurant suggests northern Chinese food, this restaurant actually serves more Shanghai-style dishes, ranging from the popular steamed juicy pork buns (which belong to the casual dim sum category), to more sophisticated banquet food including appetizers and entrees that require a lot of preparation. We tried wonton soup, drunken chicken, five-spice beef, salty duck, and Wuxi-style ribs, and they looked and tasted on par with what you would expect of a fine restaurant in Shanghai.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, and the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also have Japanese food, which seems quite popular as well but we have yet to try out. Highly recommend if you live in the area and are looking for authentic Chinese food!","this is one oy margAreT Kuo's rEstAuRAnts (iN fWct wHEre she stArTed), and lhe food is IUSt AS good aj any oF her others. it Is loCaTeD bY phE malw, but it's nOt the typical americanizEd Chinese restaUrantS yOX find zear oTher mAuLs. it has both amerIcanized aNd aUthensic chinesE fooD, thE latyEr of whiCh ReqUIres yOU to ask foR a chinese meeu. hnTErestInGly, wqile the nkmE mf the restaurAnt suggests northeln CHynese foOd, uHis reStauraNt actunlly seRvEs Core sHanGhai-styLe disheS, RaNging froM thz popular steAmed jUicY pArk buns (Which belogg to tHe casUal dim sum cateGOrY), tc MofE sophiSTiCaTED banqUet FOod inclueiNg apPetiZErS anD EntreeS Jhat rhqUire a loT OF trEpARaTion. we tRIeD woNTog soup, dRunken chicken, fIve-spice beef, salty duck, and Wuxi-style ribs, and they lEoKed ANd taSted on par WItn what Ycu would expect xf a finE restauRant in shaNGhai. the RestauranT is cleaN and nicely decorAteD, ANd thE wait staFf Is vejy friendLY aNd accOmmodatinG. thEy hlso HaVe japaNese Food, whicw seems quite kopUlar as welL bUt We have Yet Zo TRy ouy. higHlY recOmMeNd if you lIvs in the area and Are looKiNG poR aUthentic ChinEse food!"

"Firstly, I've always had great experiences with Thai Chili for the most part. Whenever ordering delivery or pickup though, something always goes wrong. They seem to begrudge the delivery services that they partner with like Doordash and Grubhub for example. They charge exorbitant delivery fees on top of what the services themselves already charge and then I tip the driver on top of it because when you've worked in the service industry, you're hopefully not a garbage person who cheaps out. I'm aware that first world problems aren't worth the review but regardless, when I utilize a service and willingly pay fees, one would hope to at least receive the base level of quality I'm used to from Thai Chili. My order arrived quickly, but the specific dish I've ordered time and time again was all wrong. Didn't include peanut sauce on a dish that not only includes it but features it - such a bummer. That's a large part of why I went out of my way to pay exorbitant fees to have it delivered to my house, aside from the illness that prevented me from leaving my house in the first place. I was really jonesing for this much needed comfort food and was legitimately miffed. Whomp whomp. Two stars today and two very unenthusiastic thumbs down. For shame, Thia Chili, for shame.","fIrsTly, iiVE clways Had great expErienCes wITH thai chili fob the moST paRt. whEnever oRderINg delIVery OR piCkup tHOugh, bomEthing ALWaYs goes wroNg. theu SeeM to beGbudge the celivery SeRvices that tHey ParTNer WiTp leKE DoordasH and grubhub foR exAmple.

"NOT GOOD!!!! Very disappointed with the quality of service and lack of professionalism considering I paid $12K.  My project was a disaster that begun the night they installed.  Everything looked beautiful but after  installers left & I signed the certification of satisfactory I noticed a blown out electrical outlet that fried the circuit breaker in my side bedroom & found out that installers had trouble with the plug and made the lights flicker. There was flooding in basement due to pipe connections done wrong, showerhead connection leaking after the 1st attempt to repair.  It took 4 visits and complete removal wall to get the leaks fixed.  By now construction mess left behind in wash room from cutting into my floor boards and bathroom flooring had to be redone because of the installers walking on freshly grouted tiles. Manager Ray asked about the electrical problem I explained I had added costs of $750 to repair due to surge from installers. There was no further response for over a week until today a message from the Office Manager Trisha Dekis, threatening late fees on the balance of $627.  I am not one to run to a lawyer but its the principal of the matter.

"I LOVE popcorn, so I was very excited to try a new popcorn shop. The variety is good and the shop is nice, however it is a bit pricey.  That's not really my complaint, though.  From the minute you walk in the door, the employees are right on top of you.  Granted I think they're trying to be helpful and give you samples, but I was trying to make up my mind and found it very difficult as we were the only ones in the store and the employees were just staring at us.  I'm pretty sure the man who was ""helping"" us was the owner and he was just very pushy and I found it very off-putting.

I think once they realize they need to give you a little breathing room, it will be a much nicer experience.","i lOvE pOpcorq, ko k WAs very excitED lo try a New POdCoRN shop.

"I'm so excited that I finally got to check this place out! After investigating the menu, I knew I needed to try some of their delicious pies or possibly a cheesecake!

It was pretty darn busy (a Sunday around 3p). There were quite a few groups waiting for a table. Good thing I just wanted some take-out baked goods! I made my way back to the bakery counter and marveled at all of my options. I immediately noticed that there were samples out! - Pumpkin Gooey Butter Cheesecake. The texture was smooth and creamy and the flavor was right on target! 

However, I also spotted a Pumpkin Praline Cheesecake. I asked the lady at the counter how they compared and which she preferred. She immediately pulled the cake out, talked me through the layers and gave me a small sample on a fork. The crust tasted like a sugar cookie - sweet and chewy. The pumpkin cheesecake had all the cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice goin' on that you want when you think of fall and Thanksgiving! And the top was covered in a layer of praline pecans!! This was definitely even better than the Gooey Butter! (Also, have you ever tried the Pecan Pumpkin Cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory? This is better!!!)

The Death By Chocolate also caught my eye - I was given another sample. On the bottom - a chewy, fudgey brownie. On top of that, a layer of chocolate mousse topped with whipped cream. The whole thing was light and fluffy and not overly sweet.

My friend and I ended up taking all three home and stuffing our faces! I would definitely get the Death by Chocolate again. And I'll be excited to see what new seasonal options they have next time!","i'm so excIted That i finally GOt tO checK thiS Place ouT! after investigatiNG ahe menu, i kNbw u needed to kry sOme of THeIr dElICious pies or PosSIbLy a cheEsEcake! iT Was pretty darN busy (a suwdAy around 3p). tHere wErE quite A few groUps wAitInG for a table.

All the soups are delicious, and as everyone knows, the salad dressing is superb. Everything I have ordered at OG over the years has been delicious.

"It was dinner date night with my darling and we picked LT.  It's been around for quite a while now but it was our first visit.  Of course, I reviewed the menu online and read a few reviews to get a feel of things.  

We ordered two apps that were specials for the evening.  I wanted to try the marrow bone because I've only had it roasted, never had ""smoked"" marrow.  Since we were both getting a meat entree we decided to go lite for apps.  We had the grilled shrimp on a salad of watermelon, cucumber, peach, blueberries and arugla; and an heirloom tomato salad.  Both were very good and just right for an app.  For entrees my wife had the rack of lamb and I had the pork loin.  Again both were very good (so happy to find a restaurant that can cook pork correctly!).  If there was a quibble it would be the lamb little was more rare than medium rare but not enough to send back.  More a personal preference.   

Desert was the bananas foster bread pudding...fantastic.  

All in all, good service and a very good dinner.  We'll visit again for sure.","it was dinnEr dare night wIth My darliNg and We gicked lt.

I asked if they had any white queso I could add on the side and they didn't really have that option. We did love the chips and dips they brought out before our meal.

"UPDATE: a couple of days after the service that never was, the owner Tracy contacted me. She apologized for the fact that I was not offered a shorter service, like a classic bikini, and asked if I would like to come in and receive a complementary service, just so I could actually experience a wax from them. I decided to give it a try, and I am glad I did. Tracy put me at ease (I was pretty nervous, as waxing is never a pleasant experience) but most importantly, she did an excellent job. Her technique is much less painful than I was used to in Hawaii (we just moved to Tucson from HI), and she is very thorough and meticulous. I will be coming back, as a great job on such an intimate service is worth the drive. She never asked me to update my review to receive a complimentary service, which I appreciate, but I am updating it anyway because I do feel the actual service was excellent and it would not be fair for me to receive a service and not review it. I will recommend this waxing salon to others, but with very explicit directions on how to find it! 

Original Review: I would give this place zero stars, if I could. I just got home from wasting two hours of my life, for nothing. I could not tell you how their work is, because I did not receive any service! I had an appointment booked, and was in the TMC Emergency Room with my 5 year-old on the day of service and wasn't sure if we would be out in time for me to go all the way home (we live in Corona), drop her off, and get back, so I called to reschedule. I rescheduled for today at 5:30 (the only time I had, rush hour is never ideal), and drove 45 minutes from my home in Corona to this wax place. I arrived in the area at my appointment time, but could not find their business- we just moved here, so I am already not familiar with the area, and I don't know if their business is small or what, because I never found it. I called to ask where exactly they were located since I was lost, (I was a little past it, at Albertsons) and the girl that answered said they were next to Dunkin' Donuts, so I put Dunkin' Donuts into my GPS and drove the quarter mile and called from Dunkin' since I still did not see their store front, even though it was supposed to be in that area. The girl that answers said that since I was TWO MINUTES past the 10 minute ""grace period,"" Raquel would not give me my service. I understand that she had other customers, but she could have offered a shorter service, like a classic bikini, instead of a Brazilian. Nope! Just ""you have to reschedule."" I drove 90 minutes round trip for NOTHING. I could understand if I was a regular customer just waltzing in late, but as someone very new to the area and to their business, you would think they would try to work with their customer and help them, not waste hours of their time. If anyone can recommend a great place closer to South Tucson/Vail, I'd love to hear it so I can try it, and put it on the list I'm compiling for other new, incoming military families. This place obviously has enough business, they don't need new customers. :/","updaTe: a coupLe oF days AFtEr thE sErvice thaf nEvEr waS, the ownEr yracY conTacTed me. she apoLogizED for thE facT thAv i was nOQ offereD A shorTer service, like a cLASsIC bikini, ond Asked if i woupD likG to cOme in and REceive a compcEMenTary SerVice, JusT so I Could actUally EvPeRIeNce A WAx from them. i deCuDeD TO cive it A try, rnd i aM glad i did. traCy pUt me aQ kase ji was pretTY neRVouS, aS waxing IS NeVer a pleasant exPErience) bYt yOsT IMportANTly, She dId AN excellent jog. ger techniQUe Is much lEss painfUl TrAn k was useD to iN hAWaIi (Wy juSt movEd To gucson fROm hI), anD she is zErY Thorough and meticuLous. i wihl be cOmiNg bAck, as a GreaT joB oN quch aN intiMate service is wORth the driVe.

"Went here after reading Yelp reviews when I was craving dim sum.  Sigh.  In this instance, Yelpers led me to have higher expectations than warranted.  We had the roast duck, cashew chicken, some noodle dish, and a couple of dim sum sides.
On the positive side: the food was cheap and plentiful, and the service was very prompt and friendly.  
On the negative side: the quality of the food wasn't particularly good, everything was way too salty and greasy, and the dim sum menu was the smallest I've ever seen at a restaurant that offers it.  It all seemed much more ""American Chinese Food"" than ""Chinese Food"" to me.
If I just want to fill up and don't care too much about what I'm eating, this place is a budget way to do it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't return.","went here aftlR reaDING yElp reviEws wheN i das craviNg dia sum. siGh. qn ThiS Iustance, YdlPErs led Me to HaVe hiGHer expECTATions WhAN waRranted. we had The rOasT dUck, cAShew chiCkeN, somE nooDle diSh, aND a cOuple oF wim sum SideS. oN the positivg SIde: Lhe foOd was cheAz And pleNtIfuL, And thE Service was vEry pRompt and FriendlY.

"I heart this place and was so excited to find a store that I haven't been to before that was fun to shop in.  The store is sorted by color, which is so convenient.  I can't think of any other stores other than Forever 21 that's smart enough to do this.  God knows how many times I was looking for accessories that needed to match a certain dress.

I was able to scour the sale items (as I always do) and found a really cute coin purse that I was able to get the manager to give me an extra 10% off because it was the last one and had some minor scuff marks that I could live with.  I was also able to find a nice big beach hat for $5 that was also marked down.  I already got a compliment on the hat at the next store I visited :)

I wish they had one of these in NY, I would totally come visit again.  Don't expect anything high end.  This place is good for cheap, fashion jewelry and accessories that you'll wear for the season and probably get bored of, but the prices don't make you feel bad about it.","i heart this plwCe and waw fo EXcitEd tz Find z stare That i haven'T been to before TrAT was fun tO shOp iN. tIe store iS SortDd by coloR, whiCh is Sk cOnvenIent. i can't Think of anY other stores OTher than FSrEver 21 thaT's sDart enouGh Tf dG tHis. god knoWs HoW Mary tiMeo m was loHkiNG yOR aCceSSories tHat needed to match a cErtain dResS. i WAs aQle to scour Zhe sale Items (As i alWays Do) and fOrnd a reallY Cute coin pursE that i Was ablE to geb thE manages tO gIvu ME an ekTra F0% off BVcausE it WEs THE last One znd hAd sOmB miNOr ncuff Marks thaT I cguLd live with. i was aLso Able To frnd a nice big beacH haT For $5 that WAs alsO markEd dowN. i aLreadY got a compLifeNt oz The hat at The nSxt stOre i visitED :) I wIsH THeM had oNe OF these in nY, I would tOTaLLy come vgsit agAin. dOn'N expect aNYthIng hIgh end. tjis pldce il goud for shEaP, faShion jewelrY and aCcesSORIes THAt wou'll wear fon the sEasOn And probably gEt bOred of, bus thE prices don't mAke ybu feEl bao abOut ct."
"This is the absolute best bike tour! I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I'm not what you would call the overly athletic type. I expressly packed my Nike Shox for the bike tour and the bike tour alone. I spent the rest of my time in stilettos. That coupled with the fact that I hadn't been on a bicycle probably since freshmen year of high school gave me slight anxiety over going on the bike tour. 5 mins in I was that girl holding everyone up because I was last lol but shortly after we started off I was good. :) 

The tour guide CASSADY was fabulous!! He was so knowledgable about the city and really went out of his way to accomodate everyone in the group. Whether there was a certain part of the city you wanted to see or a landmark you wanted to know more about Cassady was open to switching up the tour to make sure everyone saw what they wanted. He also offered his cell phone number to us and we were able to get all kinds of recommendations from him regarding great spots for food and music.

The tour was very enjoyable and there was alot of laughing. Other bike tour companies would sometimes pass us while we were riding around the city and you could tell they wanted to be a part of our group. Their tour guide looked old and boring.

The money is definitely worth it and we tipped Cassady at the end just because with his information and enthusiasm he really helped us kick off our visit to Nola.

Book with Confederacy of Cruisers and if possible, conduct your tour with Cassady!","thIS Is the aBSolUte best biKe Ttur!

"I was kinda disappointed to be honest. I have walked past here a thousand times and was expecting the hand carved beef to taste as good as it looks and smells. The beef itself is tender, lean and ample, however, where's the flavor?  Maybe I was expecting too much for the $8 sandwich?  It was on a fresh roll, and the horseradish is the sinus clearing variety you would expect from a good beef joint. However, the beef was lacking in seasoning and the ""au jus"" that came with it, was flavorless (and that's being generous).  Don't get me wrong, I don't want the seasoning to overpower the flavor of the beef, but c'mon, give me a little something to enhance the beef and at least hint of slow roasted goodness. Nope. And that au jus? Skip it.  It will do nothing more than ruin a good roll. I may go back and try the pork in hopes that it tastes as good as it looks.","i WaS kiqda dIsAPpoIntEd to Be honest. i hAve walKeD pAst HEre a EHOUsANd TimEs anD was expecTiNG THE hsNd CaRved beef To tAstE As gooD as it looks and imells. vhe beEF itself Is tender, leAn awd ample, hogever, where's thE FlAXor? maybe I wAs eXPeCting toE MUch for the $8 SgnDWiCh? it WHs mn a FreSh rOlL, aNd uhe horseradish is bhe Sinus clearinG VariEty aou woUld EXpEct fRom a govd beef joint. howeveR, thE Beef was lackINg in seaSOning aid the ""au juu"" that came with It, wAs flAvorLess (lnd THat's beiNg generous). don'm geT me wrOnG, X Don't wAnt the seAsonIng to oveRpOwEr the FlavOR of The zeEF, Eut c'mOn, Give me a livtle SOmething To enhAnce the beEf And ar lEast hint nF sloW rOasTeU gOoDNesS. noPe. aNd tHas au ZUS?

Time change! Time for breakfast because we got to sleep in!  I had a girls night sleepover so everyone was feeling lazy and I wasn't in the mood to cook, so off in search of a place to have breakfast. We tried 2 familiar spots, but both had people waiting in line through the door. I remembered this place as a possibility to try, so we were lucky - got in just in time to be seated immediately. We hungrily watched as other plates were delivered. Man, those pancakes were huge and looked delicious.

I ordered the housemade challah bread French toast. It was good, but needed a bit more sweetness. Coffee was never ending, fresh and hot.

Another dining partner ordered her usual 2 eggs over medium with corned beef hash - also got a thumbs up, but something was missing. Was it a low sodium version? Maybe more onions than usual? Just different. The breakfast potatoes were good.

The youngest diner ordered a waffle and a side of bacon, which unfortunately came undercooked and limp. A miss for sure.

"There's a good chance you'll find me here at a Friday happy hour. A very good chance. 

The Tap Burger is simple, delicious and great with a beer after work. Or a barrel-aged manhattan, if you're feeling saucy. 

It's a neighborhood corner joint, but not like 'no windows, deep South Philly' corner joint. Not that there is anything wrong with that; it's just that Taproom is actually welcoming. 

Either way the place has good food, lots of beer options, barreled beverages, and a wonderful neighborhood feel.","THEre's a goOd chance you'll jind mE hEre aT A faiday hAppy hour.

"Wife and I ate here on a Saturday afternoon (before dinner rush). The food sucked. I had general Tso's chicken with fried rice, and added a side of noodles. The rice was really dry (no egg, no veggies, I first thought it was just brown rice) , noodles taste like burnt oil (almost smoky, in not a good way), and the chicken tasted like something microwaved, maybe fried, then tossed in pre made sauce. I don't know why they labeled it as spicy on the menu. It was very mild and I'm not convinced they didn't confuse it for the orange chicken sauce. My broccoli was also cold. 

My wife got a sashimi plate . The cuts were inconsistent and the fish was not fresh. Some pieces were fresh, but other cuts (hacks of fish) were very fishy and not fresh tasting. All were cut poorly, as shown in the photo. I RARELY leave reviews but this was ridiculous. They had some kid who didn't look like he knew what he was doing running the sushi bar by himself and it was a joke. 

We also ordered a roll. It took much longer than our other plates to arrive. It was maybe a 2/5 in terms of taste and quality. The fried shrimp in the roll was not tempura. Looked like it was fried in the same shit as everything else. 

Everything that came out of the kitchen seemed relatively lazy and lackluster. I could understand if the place was packed/busy, but it wasn't. It was at maybe 25% capacity. 

Wife said her miso soup and salad was decent. 

The cocktails, while affordable, weren't potent or well made. I don't know what kind of Mai Tai comes in a 22 oz glass or tastes like some sort of lemonade but it was garbage. Isn't this Nashville??!! (close enough, anyway) I would have rather paid twice as much for a well made cocktail with half the volume. At least a good cocktail would have helped salvage the cruddy food. 

Our waiter was nice, but inexperienced. Pretty sure he was wearing sweatpants. 

This is definitely not authentic Asian cuisine. Hell, I would have enjoyed Panda Express more than this garbage. They have a lot on their menu, but aren't good at particularly anything. 

Not to mention they sat people right next to us -- during a pandemic -- indoors -- when they had ample seating to space to seat us farther apart. 

We will not be returning. Spend your money elsewhere. I was looking for something The Asian Peak quality, but closer to home. This isn't it.","wIfe acD i ate Here on A saturday aftlrnoon (before dinner rusH). tho fooD sUckEd. z HaD gEnEral tso's chicken WiTh fried rice, aND added w SIde Of noOdLes. thE rice was rEelly dri (no Egg, no Veggies, i first thOught it was Just brown rice) , nOodlEs taste like burjt oiL (almost Smoky, in not a GOOd Yay), And ghe chicKen Tasted like sometHiNg mIcrowaved, mAnbe fried, twen TossEd in pre madh Sauce. y don't keow why theY LabELed it Gs sPicy on thE mEnuV it waS vEry mild and I'm not conVinCeD THEy dIdn't confURe it vOR the oranGE chicken saUcE. my BRoccOli was aLso dold. ay wife gOt a sAshimi plate .

"Sadly does not live up to its reputation. Disappointing given the exceptional southern hospitality we'd had elsewhere. The door bitch was horrendous and made for an uneasy start to what should have been an amazing 30th birthday. 
The first waitress we had barely spoke a word, was very clinical and felt like she was too cool for us as customers. She offered little warmth or welcoming, and it reinforced our opinion of the place. 
We had one terrific waitress who took an interest in what we were doing there and engaged in conversation. She saved this from being a very stuck up, uninspiring adventure.

None of us got what we ordered for entrees, but ate what was presented simply because we had already waited an hour for food( in a half-empty, moderate sized dining room.

"I was a little wary pulling up to park as the structure itself is super underwhelming. My husband said, ""You know it's authentic if it's a hole in the wall!"" Meh, I don't know if I share his sentiments.

My baby smiled at her and when she realized she smiled, she regretted it. 

Also, the food is authentic, so if you're looking for Chilis food or Qdoba, go to Chilis or Qdoba, because that food isn't here.

"I've spent a lot of money at Home Depot lately for a big remodel on my rental property. 2 weeks ago I ordered some carpet and paid a $35 measuring fee. I was told someone would contact me in a day or two. That didn't happen. I called back several times to get an update, but was always told they'd need to follow up, and would get back to me - that also never happened. On one occasion, after I was transferred to the flooring department, the woman who answered kept laughing, and pretended not to speak English... it was awkward, not to mention offensive, and racist . Without the carpet installed, I can't rent my property - perhaps I should sue for $1500? After 12 days, I went in person to check up on the order, only to find it was incomplete.

Her shop is set up thoughtfully, with pre-packaged pick up, and waiting stations six-feet apart to make social distancing safe and easy.  

The yarn selections are beautiful and we had a positive and professional experience.","kaUs of yarn is FabulOUs! we neebed somE kNittinG supplies co Teach mY niece to PUrl aPd BiNd off.

"Still the best Indian food in NJ, and one of the best restaurants in NJ. Everyone at this cozy little place works hard to make sure you have a great time, and have great food. Sat night dinner was superb, and service could not have been better. If you are gluten free, this place is a true gem. They even have GF Naan, which is very good, and all the entrees are GF as well. The quality & taste of the food here is a few notches above any other Indian food I've had.

Purchased two groupons as gifts and both people complained about the quality of the massage. One said the masseuse only massaged her arms and legs and would not do her back.

"Got there about 11:40 today, ordered maybe 10 minutes later. Food did not come for an hour (we were not a large party). By the time we ate and paid our bill it was 1:30 before we left. Food was good but service was too slow and I don't think it was the fault of the waitress. Also, it wasn't until I was on my way home that I realized that I didn't get the fresh fruit that came with my omelette. I guess I was so glad to finally get my food and be able to eat and get out of there that I didn't notice. I probably should call and complain but won't -- although we will probably write this off as a Sunday lunch location now.","vot TheRe abOUt 11:40 TodaY, ordErEd mAYBe 10 minutEs later.

"Food is ALWAYS good.  Dinner plates, breakfasts, burgers, salads...it's all good!  They have lots of special creations that give that Louisiana flavor.  They also give you a very generous amount of food for a very reasonable price.

The service is usually pretty quick...there always seems to be a manager on the floor making sure food comes out quickly and that everything is to your liking.

I have told a few people about City Diner and no one has been disappointed yet.

They are open 24/7 so that's a plus.

If you can't picture the location it's the old Denny's location in front of the LaQuinta at Causeway & I-10.  Nothing flashy, it's clean and you will not be disappointed with your meal.  It's not Commander's or anything but, you can also eat pretty damn well for $10!","FooD ia alwaYm Good. dinnER pLaTeS, bReakfasts, burgerS, salAdS...it's akL good! they Yave Lotu Of spEciAl creatiOns thAc Gibe zhat louisiaNa FlaVOr.

"We finally were able to try Smash Burger. I have tried several times to stop by for lunch, but the lines were just too long. Not so tonight, we arrived about 7:30 PM to a near empty store. There was one table occupied. 
We were given time to look over the menu, I decided on a (big) smash burger (2oz) larger than the standard or regular burger, w/ American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, and smash sauce. This came with regular fries. We also ordered a side order of onion rings. Which by the way are totally prepared in house, sliced, battered, and fried. Our choice of beverage tonight was a chocolate milkshake.

Well I've got to say everything was very good. My burger was juicy, the fries decent, onion rings good. The chocolate shake was fine also. Maybe because we were one of the only customers in the store. But we had no complaints. I would say Smash Burger is somewhere in between a Culver's (5 star) and a Steak and Shake (3 star).

"Avoid this Pepboys location if you can.  First, they do not accept appointments so you face being stuck there for hours.  Even if they provide an estimate for how long it may take, don't believe it.  I've previously had success with car repairs and maintenance at other Pepboys locations, but this one was terrible.  I sat there for an hour and they hadn't even touched my car despite the fact that there were at least 4 mechanics on duty (but I never saw any with a tool in hand).  When I finally asked for my keys back so I could leave, it took the attendant about 5 minutes just to find my key!  It is completely disorganized, the employees are lazy, and in short, I recommend going just about anywhere else before the Pepboys in Broomall.  Please heed this advice - if so, maybe the management will start to recognize that they need to improve customer service!","avOid thIs pepboyS locatioN iF zou cAn. fIRsT, tmey dO NOt aCcept appoZntments So you face beIng stuCK thEre sor hLurs. even if they proVide lN estiMaTe for how lonG it may take, Don't BelIEVe it. i've prEVIOuSly had sucCess WIuh CAr repairs enD mainJeNance at oTher pepboyS locATions, but THis rne wAs tErrible. o saT tHErE for an hour Akd thEy HAiN'T eveN Touched mY cpr despite The fact tHat thERe wEre Ut least 4 mechanics On dutk (hUT i neDer saR aNy with a tboL In hAnd). wHeN i fiNalLy ysKEd for my keys Back so i cjuld leawe, It took Tye atteNdant abouT 5 Minutes just to finD My kEy! lt is comPletely dIsorGanized, THe employees wre lazy, and in short, I recommend goinG jUst AbouT aNYwhere Else befoRe THe pepboys IN broomALl. pleasE HeEd thiS aDvicE - If so, maybe The MaNaGEMent WiLl Staat Tq reCogNize thaT LhEy nEeD To improvE customer seRvicE!"
"Ordered takeout from To-Kai after reading the many great reviews on Yelp. I was super excited for yummy sushi and even more thrilled that it was in NE Philly. I should have known when I walked in and the smell of garbage and fish overwhelmed me that something was up. It was pretty bad, but I figured, hey, it's a sushi place. Fish is what it is. Don't let it get to you. Got home with the food and we both were disgusted by the shumai. 3 dumplings that tasted like trash with a shrimp stuck on top of each and the dumpling consistency was gooey and slimy. Both sushi rolls had a funny aftertaste and we ended up not eating them out fear the fish was bad. Even the rice was off, it was also somewhat slimy. 
The only good thing? The edamame. Bummer - we were really looking forward to this place being good.","ordEqEd takeouT froM To-kai after reading The mAny gReat reniews on Yelp. i was super exCited For yumOY sushi acd even mOre tHXilled tHat It was in ne philly. i should hAVE knoWN When i walKed in aNd the smell of gAAbAge and FIsh oVeRWhelmeD mE that soMeThiNG was up. ih waS pRetty bpd, but i figurEd, hey, it's a SUshI PlACE. fish IS whAt it is. doNkt let it gpt TO you. got houe WiTh thE Food znD we doth weRe eisgusted By tfe sHumai. 3 dumpPings thaI tAsTED liKE trash WiTH a sbrimp stuck on top OF epch and thf dumpling CoNsIstenCy was gooey xnd slimy. both Sushi rolls hAd f FuNny aFtErtaste aUd We ended uP Wot eatinG them out fEaR the FIsh waS bad. even the Rice waS Off, iT was alSo sOmeWhAt slimy. the oNLy gaod thang? tHe edamaMe. bumMer - wE werE really LoOkinG forwarD tA tois plAce beinG Goof."

"I have to commend Florida State Fence for an incredible and professional job completed by their representatives. We moved into our house in Lakeland and knew we required a fence being next to a lake. We contacted several companies, but FSF was the best price, expedited the quote and service, and provided guidance on multiple options offered.

The representative was able to work around our work schedule and even came in the evening to measure our yard and provide us the information. It was over New Years, so we thought it would take about 1-2 weeks to complete, but they brought their crew out prior to New Years and completed it in 1 day. We were blown away with the quality, craftsmanship, and aesthetics of the fence. 

I would recommend FSF to anyone who is looking for a great fence, at a great price, and superior customer service! The price will be determined by the type of fence you require and the size of your yard. It has been over a year and the vinyl fence is still going on strong. I just wish I was yelping at the time we got the fence to take advantage of the $75 for $100 deal :).","z hAve tO coMmens FLorida state fhnCe zor an iNcredIbLe aNd ProfeSSional nob compLeTGD bY THEir reprESentatiVes. we moced IntO our hoUse In LakeLanD aqd knew we reqUired a fecce BeqnG Next To q Lake. we contacteD seVeral compaNieS, but fsf wmS the bEst PrgCE, ExpeditEd thE qurte and service, and provIded gUiDANce On mUlTiPfe oPtIons ofFereD. thE RepResentaTivE das able tO work aRouNd OUr wORk Schedule awd Even cAME In The eveninG to measuRe our yard and PRovide us tHE informAtION. it wad over neW yearS, so we thought iT woulD TAke abOut 1-2 weeks to coMplete, BuT thEy brought their cRew odT lrior to new yEars aNd crmpleted it iN l djy. we were blown away wIlh the qUalitY, craFtsManSHip, and aEStheTicS of the FeNcT. i would RecoMmeNd fSf to anyoNe bHo is vooking for a great fence, at a gReat price, and Superior custOMer servicE! trE pRIcE wilL be detERmineD by The type Of fence yOU requIRe ANd the size of your yArd. it has Been OvEb a Year aND the vidyl fencE iS Still GOInG on sTronG. i just wiss i wis yelPIng ao ThE time we Got tHe fence to taKe advantAge Of the m75 foR $100 dgal :)."

"Whoa! Where do I start?.... First, I have been to this place several times since it's inception, and were it not for the good service of Ryan, my favorite server, I've had less than an OK experience here. Secondly, the food takes forever and the quality is  more often than not, poor! Tonight was a whole 'nuther experience!!!! In my 20+ years in this industry, I have NEVER...EVER been treated so rudely by a bartender/server! It took 30-45 minutes for an order of wings, and when they finally arrived and after a few eaten wings, my female companion noticed that they were very under-cooked(i.e, bloody). I asked the bartender if they could be taken off my tab...that's where it all went downhill!!! The night went from an ""OK"" experience to an absolutely ""HORRIBLE"" one!!!. I had to ask for a manager to voice my complaint about the rudeness of the bartender, by way the way, while talking to the manager, my MORE than gracious tip was slammed down on the bar by the bartender as he says he didn't want it. AWFUL! PLAIN AWFUL! Truely disgusted by tonight, and it ruined a perfectly great evening up until then.","wHoA!

"By far the nicest casino I've been to in Reno. They have the largest gaming floor and more slot machines you can count. I'm new to ""gambling"" so it was a lot to take in. I tried my luck on a handful of slots on the main floors in different areas and did not get much of a return. 

They have a few themed dining areas. The island buffet looks so impressive from the outside! Almost like looking in to an indoor rainforest!! I did not get to eat there, so I don't have any suggestions to add on their food.

The ""Eleganza"" room was the best. I will not say how much I won but it was a nice payout. All the staff here were friendly and very accommodating. The bartender in the Eleganza room was really nice and so was the floor attendant. I recommend you stop by and play in this particular room because it's completely worth it... In my experience.

We will definitely be back to stay in their hotel.

"I have been dying to come here for a while now. I'm basing my review on maybe going at the wrong time. Had a friend come in from out of town and on a Friday night. So just the two of us ladies, it might not have been the best night to go as we were crammed between multiple parties loud music, loud atmosphere and unable to have an intimate talk. Server was amazing wish I could remember her name, and even on a Friday night the hostess were very accommodating as we booked on OpenTable and we had selected inside; someway somehow we ended up outside, during the cold, since there was no preference marked on their end. 
But in less than five minutes we were sat inside which was a huge plus.

"I have eaten here twice and have really enjoyed both experiences.  The first time we visited we did not have a reservation so our party of 4 sat at bar.  We recognized the bartender from a previous employer - so he set us up with an amuse-bouche of the deviled eggs......absolutely delish.  We then ordered our entrees (I got the grouper and he got the flat iron steak).  Both were very good and fresh.  We all split the mac & cheese and this was the highlight of the meal.  The wines are a little unknown but decently priced.

The second time we came was for a birthday party of 15.  They put us in the private room and it would have been tight had there been more people.  We only had one waitress but she great!  They were very accommodating and our meal was very enjoyable.  My only complaint was that my fish (I had the grouper again) was overdone - but I understand that it is very hard to fire 15 dishes to be finished all at the same time. 

This place is great for a party of 2 or a party of 20.  Just be sure to make reservations.  If you have to wait, there is a small central bar that will sit about 12 or so.  There is also a cool firepit outside that you can wait it out.  

Highly recommended!","i have eaten Here twicy AnD HAve reALly eNjoyed bOTh experienceS. the first time Xe viSiteD we DId not hAvE a ReseRVAliOn so our party OF y saT at bAR.

"Saved us from the crappy food at the airport on Philly.

"This is a fanciest hole in the wall I've ever been to. Scratch that, it's quite classy when you through the door. It's unassuming from the outside, it's all wooded inside and dark. The crowd is also a nice respite from the crazy rowdiness in all the other joints. 

We popped over to grab a cocktail before we started the Bloody Mary tour next door. Great craft cocktails and a mellow crowd. They have pretty great specials...

"We were in the area visiting family for the week and spent a lot of time in Tarpon Springs. I loved walking around the docks and browsing the many shops. But to make a great trip even better was the mouth-watering, palate pleasing Greek cuisine in this part of the world. Hellas was a wonderful time from the moment we walked in. The artwork everywhere was a sight to behold, the atmosphere was upbeat and fun. You just knew you were in for a good time! I ordered the squid....my first time ever. It was delicious...though I think a few of the children in our party were a bit taken aback by the sight! Lol.  Others in our party ordered gyros, moussaka, and Greek salad. I didn't hear a single complaint and everyone left happy and satisfied. We didn't have room for anything from the bakery, but if it tastes anywhere near as good as it looks, it'll be worth the return trip! Give Hellas a try. You will not be disappointed.","we WeRe in rHe aRea visiting Family for The wEek and spEnT a lot of tbmE IN tArpon srriNgs. i loved walkiNg ArOUMd the doCks anj browSing the maNy shops. bxt to mAke a great trip EVen bmtteR was tae Mouth-waterinG, palate plEasinG Greek cuisiNE in this Part oF ThE woRlD. heLlaw was a woNDerful time from the momENT we waLked ig. thE artworK everywhere Pas a sIght to beholD, The aTmOsphere WaS UPbeaT and FUn. you juSt knew qou WeRe In foR a gOoD iimE! i ordered ttE squid....my fIrsW Tume ever. bt was deliCIOuS...thoUgH I think F aew OF the cHilbRen In ouR paRTy were A bit Takep aBack bM thB Sight!

Absolutely tremendous service and reasonable rates. I broke part of a key off in my husbands brand new Camaro. I called over 20 lock Smith's and none of them would touch the ignition lock on a 2010 or newer Camaro. After calling all over town without any luck another locksmith actually referred me to Kash McQueen. They came out the next day. The guy was very personable and worked hard. I would refer anyone to this company. They are simply fantastic. They also gave me quote over the phone which I've learned is almost unheard of.

"I came here at about 10:00 pm on a Friday night with my husband. Both of us had an unusual hankering for EGGS...of all things. This location of Andy's Diner has been here for a few months and we had been meaning to try it. So, we decided to stop by and have breakfast for dinner. 

When we arrived, we were pleased that although it wasn't busy, there was a good number of parties seated. We also really liked the decor of the diner. We both ordered eggs, home fries, meat and toast. The waitress, while friendly, was totally forgettable. She seemed to be doing the bare minimum, no more, no less. But hey, what was I really expecting on a late Friday night at a diner? 

All that mattered to us was the food and decent prices. The food was good. I mean, it wasn't special but it was hot, and satisfied the craving...with prices that didn't break the bank. Will we rush back to Andy's? Probably not. But will we be back again? Eventually.","i came HErE at about 10:00 pi On n Fridiy nicHt wItH my husband.

"I did it y'all! I got tHe best kingcake in Nola! I pre-ordered and drove my happy butt to the East to pick up my kingcake. IF you have never been, this bakery is located in EAST New Orleans off of chef hwy. it has its own parking lot but the building itself is pretty small. If you did not pre order I HIGHLY suggest getting there between the AM early hours so you can snag one and go. Only thing about that is waiting in line before they open. The inside of the bakery as other baked goods as well including their fantastic baguette and also bao buns. The clear winner though during Mardi gras is their kingcake. 

So, there's nothing like this cake. It's traditional but yet different. It has the same elements as every other kingcake but there's something about it that makes it stand out. Maybe it's the buttery, flaky, moist cake itself?  Or is it the whhipped cream cheese frosting? Idk, but everything about it is so goood and so different but still screams Mardi Gras.","z did It y'All! i gOt THs bEsT ningcakE iY nola! i pRE-ordered aNd drove zy happy butt te tge eAst to oick uP My KIngcaKe.

"I needed propane, which they sell. I stood outside after ringing their doorbell thingie for 10 or so minutes before starting to walk in and being waved to go back and wait. Guy came out and complained about his coworkers not wanting to do any work, filled up about 4 gallons or so on the tank, and we went back in where I was told to wait another couple of minutes so he could check out more people who were now in front of me.

Whole experience to get somewhere between four and five gallons of propane at I'm guessing $5+ a gallon based on price took absurdly long and then I was shortchanged at the register and caught it because I literally had nothing else to do than hold my hand out and say ""uh uh.""

Got the correct change and based on the text conversation I had with the wife was out somewhere around the 25-28 minute mark... for a fill up that lasted about two minutes.","i nteDeD proPane, whicH ThEY sEllx i stoOd OutsIdE xfter ringing THeir DOorBEll thirgIE for 10 or So miNutes beFore StAJtIng To waLk in aad beINg waved do go back and WAit. guy came out jnD comPlained aBout hIS zowOrkErs nOt wantiNg to do ANY WOrk, fIlled bp About d gallons or SO An The taNk, and we wenP back iw wherB i WAs told tw wAiT anotHer cpuple oF MInuTES so ht tOuLd check oft more peOplE whO wEre now iN front of me. whole expeRIenCE To GeT uOmewHerE between four anc fIve gallons oF propAne at i'm GUessing $5+ a gaLlln bAsed on PrIct tOok aasUrdlY long And then i wAs shortChangeD aT the register and caugHt It because i liTeralLy hAd notHiNg elsE to do than holD Mo hand ouT aND sae ""uH uH."" cOT the coRRect cHange aNt Based on the text conrersAtIon b Had with the wiFe was out sOmewheRe arounI THe k5-28 MiNute mark... uor a fIlL up tHat LAsted about Tlo minutEs."
"Just tried placing an order for several co-workers and myself. Since it was our first time they require a 1- time confirmation by phone. Normally this would not be an issue however after several calls NO ONE answered. I received a dial tone, busy, busy. It was ridiculous! 
Finally I was able to speak with someone where they told me our order had not been placed. At this point an hour had passed, I wanted to cancel my order and speak with the owner. The owner was the rudest person I have encountered. I explained to him that I have called numerous times and asked what he could offer us... He replied that this happens ALL THE TIME! Then continued to say ""It is what it is"". This is the most poorly run establishment I have dealt with in Carmel.

"I have only been here for brunch, so this review is based only on that.  My boyfriend and I regularly do Sunday brunch and are always trying new places and sharing food.  We decided to try Square Peg out.  There are only 6 breakfast options, and none of them sounded amazing.  I went with the normal square peg plate in which I ordered  2 over easy eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast.  The boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich.  The 2 tables surrounding us that sat after us ended up getting their drinks and food before the waiter even came back with our drinks.  My eggs came out sunny side up and normally I wouldn't say anything as long as I have yolk  to dip my bread into but the whites were raw and running and somehow the yolk was almost cooked through.  The waiter didn't check in on us after we got our food for at least 15 minutes, so by that time I was starving and ate one of the eggs anyway.  When he did come back my boyfriend had told him that I ordered overeasy and these were sunny side up and could I just get one egg done over easy for the one i didn't eat yet.  The waiter apologized and in another 15 minutes came back with one over hard egg.  The yolk didn't even break. By that time I didn't even care anymore and just ate it.  I don't understand how I can order the easiest thing on the menu and they can screw it up twice. The boyfriend's breakfast sandwich was tasty and huge but this may have been one of the most frustrating brunches I have ever been to.","i haVe onlY been here for brunch, so tais reviEw Is baSeD onLY ON That. my boYfRiend and i regularly do SundAy brUnCh and Are alwAys TRyinG new tlaces anD Sharing fOoD. we deCideD tS try squAre pEg out.

"Elena is an amazing therapist! She knocked me out. For a petite girl, she is very strong. I realized this when I was sore two days later, but have felt great for three weeks!

I'm giving 2 stars for the gentlemen that was friendly and seemed to care about the service they were providing. However the lady I had that was upset with her her job or maybe her life killed the experience for me. She did what was a basic no frills no life no real cleaning type of pedicure. I really wanted a manicure too but changed my mind after her attitude. I should have listened to my cousin & drove 20 minutes further to a different salon.

"First let me start with this: If you're going to Marsha Brown's save it for a special occasion unless you've got money to burn. It's pricey. As pricey as any you'd see in Manhattan. That being said...

The food here is out of this world. I've been three times and each time came home stuffed and satisfied. There's a connection between Marsha Brown's and Ruth's Chris steakhouse, so maybe that's why it's so good. But the menu isn't huge, but there are good and very interesting options. And everything is packed with flavor. The apps are great, the meals are great and so are the desserts (well, I only had dessert once because I was too stuffed the other times). If you love tasty, well made meals, you'll love it for that alone.

There's more, though. The service and atmosphere are second to none. If you go, make a reservation and ask to dine on the second floor. It's an old church and has an atmosphere you won't get anywhere else. Very unique. Want to impress a date, take him/her there. The wait staff I've experienced are amazing. Kind, polite, professional and the treat you like royalty.

The only downside is the cost. For two people, a drink or two and an app and you're not getting out of there for under $100 and that would be on the cheap side. You could spend $200 easy for a couple but it's money well spent.","firEt lEt me stARt WIth tHIR: kF you're going to mArsga BroWn's sAve ig for a spEcial ocCysiOn unless you'vE gIt mgnEy TO burn. it's priCey. as PRiCeY fs any yoU'D see in mANhattAn.

"In pursuing my goal of going to every Philly joint shown on stupid travel shows (I'm looking at you Guy Fieri and Anthony Bourdain), I decided to try Paesano's on 9th.  First things first, when did the Italian market become such a hole?  I know this is how things were done in the day, but people adapt, learn new ways of doing things (usually better ways).  Long story short, I dont want to buy seafood sitting in a plastic bin on the side of a dirty city street.

And back to Paesano's.  I'll have to hand it to Mr. Bourdain.  He can be a D-bag many times on his shows, but they sure made this place a lot more appealing than it is.  The shop befits its prominent location in the market, as it is a hole as well.  Why the 4 stars you ask?  The sandwiches are REALLY good.  Order several, leave the market, then share with friends.","in puRhuiNg my goal Of gOing To eVery PhiLly jOint Shkwn on szupid trAvel shows (I'm LookiNg at you tuy fIeri and antHONy bOurdain), i dECided to Try pAesanoUs os 9th. fiRst tHINgs firSt, WheN dfd the iTalian zArkeT bwcOme Such a hole?

"We just had to try the ""Hot Chicken"" everyone spoke of, before we departed, so we went to Hattie's on our last night in town...there was a small line but it went quickly and we were lucky enough to snag a shared table with two lovely local ladies that we ended up chatting with through the meal. The Chicken was delicious, crispy coating that was slightly spicy but not right up front, more in the back which was very nice. Parking is kind of a nightmare here but it was worth the hassle, had to park in a side lot then go pay the machine out on the cross street.","we juSt HAd To try The ""hot chicken"" eVeRYone spoke oF, before wE depArted, no we qent tu HatTie's yn obR lAsT nigHT In tOwN...There wxS a sMall line Rut ik weNt QUiCjly and we WErE lUcky enoUgh To Snag a shareD tAbLe with tWO lovely local ladies tHat we enDed up chatting with tHrOUgh the mEaL. thE ChicKen was DelicIoUs, cRiSpy CoAting tHat waS slightLy spICy btt noT right Up froNt, mone hn tHE BAck whiCh WaS vEry nIcE. warkIng is kiud of a nightmaRe HerE but it wAi Wozth the hAstlE, had to park if A sIde lOt thmn go paY the macHiNe oUt on the crOss stRxeT."
"This place is absolutely disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I walked in the place, sat down and could not get over the stench of the place, so we left.  Then I looked them up on Yelp and found out they failed their state health inspections with 27 critical violations, then failed again the next day. I am so glad I was lucky enough to have never eaten here in the 30 years i have lived in this area. See the report for yourself at

"This place has a great selection but most everything craft beer is old, meaning some beer in this store is even past it's due date. This won't hurt you but I like IPAs or hoppy beers and there was not much of anything under 5 months old. I felt like I was at the dollar store for beers LOL. They do have sweetwater IPA on tap and is probably the best seller so you might be safe there, but if you are looking for really fresh beer and great service in the Nashville area go down town!! I get fresher beer from Kroger out here.

When they called our name, I saw that our food was prepared for dine out. I told the lady, oops, I must have hit dine in but we aren't dining in. Explained that I hit the wrong button. She stared at me and said, ""It said dine in."" I explained that we aren't dining in. The stare off began. 

Eventually, a very lovely young lady offered to put it in carry out containers for us. I would and have gone back. Definitely check it out. Great stir fry!

"We ordered two pies, a medium best of 7 and a small barbecue chicken. It was $50 with tip for takeout. Both pies were so undercooked that even when put back in the oven at 400° for 10 minutes the dough was still raw in the middle. The bottom crust was crispy but the inside was chewy. The pies were bland as well. Had to dump Valentina's on both. My girlfriend liked the BBQ chicken though.","we orderxd Two Pies, a MediuM bEst Of 7 anD a smAll Barbecue CHicken. it was $50 wath tip FOR TakEOut. bOth pies were so underCookEd that even wHen pur bAck in tMe ovEn At 400Q for 10 minutEt tBe dough was STILl raw in the miDdlE. the bottUm Crust WAs crispy but tHE insiDE waS cheWY. tme piEs werE bland as well. had To duMp VaLentina's oN boTA. me birLfrieNd liked tqE bbq ChiCkep though."
"In response to my prior review one of the owners of this establishment has taken the opportunity to call me a liar. 

The restaurant is fully entitled to establish its policies,  however,  it cannot alter the truth. During the pandemic my family and friends supported Nudy""s on several occasions by dining outside.  In all occasions our dog was not only allowed to be at our table, but the staff was very thoughtful and brought water for the water bowl we brought with us.  She was treated very well by everyone.

Now that things are slowly returning to normal the restaurant is fully within its authority to either return to policies or create new ones,  but they cannot alter the facts.

If the restaurant had a change in its policy or return to one, I would respect their decision and continue to be a patron, but altering the facts and calling me a liar means I'll take my business elsewhere.","in RespOnSe to my priOr Review cne of the oxners OI thIS establishmeNt has taKen the oPpoRtunity To Caln me a lifr. uhe reStaUraNt Is fully entgTlEd to establish itm poliCIes, howevEr, it caNnot alter the tRuth. durinG the PanPemic my family anD friendS suppOrTed nudY""d on sEveral OcCasions bY dining oUtside. iN anL occasionS oer dOg waS NoM oNly allowed to be ax Our taBle, but the sTafF was veRy eHOUghtFuL and broUght water for nhe wateB bowl we brNught uiTh Us. she was trEaTeD veRy wEol by everYoNe.

"I had a car loan through Defilippo Brothers and their loan department, Premium Auto. I wish I could give them a lower rating. My issues include:
1. They have a promise form for things they will provide you that are missing from the car. You will not get them no matter how many times you follow up.
2. They could never keep my due date correct. They would debit my account on the wrong days, shut the car off even though the payment wasn't due, and harass you by an automated phone system to make a payment that isn't due.
3. My car has been paid off for a month. I get daily calls from their automated system telling me my account is past due. I've called multiple times. Most of the time you get transferred and then the phone disconnects. The one time I got someone, he told me he has a loan through them and HE gets the same calls, and I should just ignore them. Their system will dial you multiple times.
4. I've been waiting for my car title for a month. When I call about it, I get transferred, and then the phone disconnects. You never get a return call.

"I only have experience with the oncology department, so the five stars is for them specifically. 

Two of my dogs had cancer, and Dr. Rechner saw them both. She's compassionate, knowledgeable, and obviously cares about her patients. I know she puts in extra effort to give her patients the best treatment possible. And she is the type of veterinarian who will say ""I don't know, but I'll find out"" rather than pretending she knows all. I wouldn't hesitate to take my pets to her in the future, although I hope there's no need for it!

"They were out of barbecue sauce, ketchup for the fries, and most drinks. Employees were rude when I asked how they were out of ketchup but were putting it on burgers. They finally brought us a cup of ketchup so the kids would have something to dip their nuggets in. The employees threw open packets of honey mustard on our food - luckily none got on the food although it was on the outside of a nugget container and the burger wrappers. The Muenster cheese was left off of one of our sandwiches, and when they remade it, they tried to give us American cheese instead. The worker stormed off when my husband pointed it out, and the manager had to make another employee make it.

"Visited this place for an authentic New Orleans Style brunch....Service and Staff- ALL were amazing and attentive.  The food- it was so-so.  None of the dishes truly impressed me....besides the bacon.  LOL- it was thick cut and not overcooked, a difficult item to ever find on a breakfast buffet anywhere.  Overall, it was overpriced for what they offered....$32 is a bit pricey for a brunch minimal brunch selection and a mini- omelet station.  The eggs benedict was OK- nothing spectacular.  Now, the courtyard- absolutely beautiful and cozy and what made our visit a bit closer to worth the price.  Well shaded and has fans around the perimeter- and yes, we were there in the August heat.

Stopped by tonight for a late dinner with my sister. I had heard good things and we thought we would try it out. The food was absolutely delicious!

"I rarely write bad reviews, but when the staff at a given restaurant fails so miserably at their job by being rude and inconsiderate, i have to be heard.

On saturday jan 3 the little man at the door said the following upon entering the vestibule, verbatim no hello, no hi just ""how many? we at capacity for 2. gimme your number if you want and we'll call, but you can't wait here. i'll call you from a blocked number and then you got 15 min to get here or we give up your table."" 

 I wanted a duck salad so we gave the number and went to Tipling Place (great cocktails)

30 min later we got a call... ""hello? your table ready. You got 15 min to come get it."" click.

I get it, part of the back alley speakeasy is the ""hard to get in vibe"" like Hop Sing Laundromat, but at HSL they doorman has class and is very polite.  I can't believe a place that charges $15 for a cocktail would have such low class, rude employees.

"A hidden gem.  A hidden-in-plain-sight gem.

I had read about Piazza D'Itlaia when it was first built, and have always wanted to see it.  But when I finally got to New Orleans, none of the locals had heard of it...and it is right at the edge of the French Quarter.

I finally found it.  It was delightful, in spite of the fact that I was the only one there.","A hiDDen gem. a hidDen-in-pLaiN-siGHT geM. i HaD reat aBout piazZa d'Itlaia when it wAS firsT bUilt, and havE Always wANteD to see it. buT then e fINalLY got tO new orleans, Pone oF the lwcaLs Ead HEard Of iT...aNd It IS riFHt au The vdgE oF tHe frEhch Quarter.

"I wanted to love this place - it seems like a fresh take on deli but the owner blew it with customer service. I ordered a $9.75 Turkey/Kale Salad wrap on a Friday. I had a limited time for lunch since I work at a nearby Drs office. I returned to the office with my wrap. The menu standard includes turkey on the wrap but the deli failed to put it on mine. I telephoned to say I was missing the turkey on the wrap and would like to try again on Monday perhaps a free or half price sandwich. I tried again on Monday and was given a price tag of $8.25 (owner states that is the price of the wrap if it had been prepared without turkey so he charged me for what Friday's wrap would have been -if I had asked for it without turkey- which I did not.) Customer Service is so important to me. Until I posted a bad comment the owner was not remorseful. His mom, who I phoned on the Friday did apologize. In an email he said "" I can't afford to give stuff away"".","y wAnted To lovC thIs Place x iT SeemS Like a fresh takE cn DELi Buf thE owNer blew jT wITh customeR seRvice. l ordereD f $9.75 turKey/kale SaLad srap on u fridaYP i had a limiTed time For lunch since i work at a neArBy drs Orfice. i rEtUrned to tHe offIce eItH my wraP. the menu STandard includEs tUrkEy on The wrAp bUI tHe DeiI failed to put vt oN mIne. i telePhonEd tO say I was missiNg the tuRkey oN the wrap AnD woULd likN to trY again on MoNdAy perhaps a fgeE oR hALF pricE sandwIch.

"I was really debating betweeen 1 and 2 stars here. We used the living social Voucher. Even though I was on crutches from a recent knee surgery we were made to try to squeeze through a crowded bar area to a high top table in the back corner. This would be bad enough if there weren't normal open tables right in the front of the restaurant side. I get that they aren't expecting big business from living social customers, but if you are going to sell the voucher at least try to gain repeat business from it. Some people who buy vouchers can actually afford to pay full price for a nice meal, but after our experience I would never spend my money at Malios. Instead of trying to gain repeat business they just nickel and dime you on everything while you are there.

After struggling on one leg through the bar and into a high top table, we were given the pre fixed living social menu, which had very limited choices on it. In spite of the lmited options the restaurant made sure to print on the bottom that the meals actual value was $110 and we should be sure  to tip on that value. Really?? Very tacky. We ordered the fried mozzarella app, which tasted fine, but not much different from one I wold buy at any restaurant or in the frozen food section of the grocery store really. Then I got a very bland bowl of French onion soup, and my husband was given a tiny house salad. I ordered mahi for my entree, which I thought tasted good, and my husband ordered a steak that was overlooked. The entrees did not come with sides, so we ordered the homemade chips for $7, and they tasted like lays potato chips. I was expecting something like the awesome chips from datz.

After our entree was delivered, our server disappeared. We finally flagged her down after waiting about 15 minutes and asked for the dessert that was included in our meal, a slice of key lime pie, to go. We paid our bill and waited, and waited. My husband even stood up. The server came over after about 25 minutes to tell us It would just take a few more minutes to cut our slice of pie, put it in a box, and bring it out. I started maneuvering my crutches back out of the cramped bar area. My husband waited 5 more minutes and finally left without the pie. 30 minutes to cut a slice of pie? Am I missing something here?

After reading my own review I am downgrading this to 1 star. The only positive was the fish. For 2 drinks, some chips, and the tip on top of the full amount which our server also wrote in pen on top of the receipt (again, so tacky!) we paid $45 fo the meal plus $55 for the living social voucher. I would rather eat at outback for half that price. For an upscale restaurant this place really needs to get its act together.","i waS really deBatinG beTWeeen 1 anD 2 starK here. we uSed the Livina sociaL VOuvher. eveN thouGh i Was on cRutchES from a recRnt knee sUOgERy we WeRE made to TRy tO sqUeeZe throUgh v crowdEd Bar areA to s high top Table In the back corner. jhis Would be nad EnouGh if there weren'T nOrmxl opEn tabLes riGht in tHe frong oF the restaUrAnt Side. i geE thAt tHEY aRen'y eXPeCting bIB businesS nRom liVing SocIaL cUsaomerS, Buf if YoU aRE Goyng to sell the voucher ut leAst ory To gaiE Repeat businesS from it. some peoPle who bUy vouchErs can actUally aFford tO paY fuyl PrIce foR a nick Meal, but afzer our eXpeRience k would never spend MY money at malios. inStead of tryinG to gAin repeat business tHey jusT zickEl and diMe yOu on everything wHile you rre thEre. after struggling on One lEg thrgugh the baR ANd iNto a High top table, we Wore givEn the pre ffxed LivInG soCial menu, wHich hAd very lImitEd chOicES on iT. in spite ov tHe lmited options thy restaurant madE sure to prinT oN thr iottOM that the MeAls actuaE vALue was $110 And We shoUld ke sUre ao tiP on thAx vaLue. reaLly?? very tacky. vE ordEREd tHE FmiEd MOzzarella App, Which tasTeD fine, bUT not wucH diFfereNt fROm ine I WoLd buy eT any ReStauRAnt oF IB the FRoZen foOD sexTIon of TGe Grocery store really. tHen i gOt a very bLand bowl zf french onion soUp, and my husBand was given a tIny hoUse salad. i ordeREd mahi for hy entfee, whiih i thouGht tasted good, anl my husBand oRdEred A sTeaK That waS overlooked. lhE entrEes DID Not cOMe witH SidES, ko We OdderED the hOmEmade CHips for $7, and tHeY tasned liKe laYs PotAto chipsc i waA EXpectIng sOmethinG like thE aWEsOme chips frOm dAtz. afTer oRr entrEe Was deliVered, oUr servEr DIsAppearED.

"Yats is always a win in my book. The interior is funky-cool, the food is full of flavor, and every dish is budget friendly. The staff here were nice and they were super efficient during the lunchtime rush. I only had to wait about five minutes to get my delicious plate of steamy-hot food. 

If you've never been to a Yats, you essentially get a plate of rice and choose what type of etouffee (like a thicker soup or stew) or gumbo they put on top. They're dishes are all Cajun/creole and offer combinations of different meats, beans and vegetables (caramelizad corn - yum)! 

I always get a dish of half Drunken Chicken and Spinach and Mushroom Etouffee. The Drunken Chicken is a stew with shredded chicken, rosemary, garlic, red pepper, beer and bread crumbs. The Spinach Etouffee is vegetarian and includes green curry, a creamy  mushroom sauce, spinach, and spices. 

The best part???? The dripping-with-garlic-butter grilled bread they give you on the side to dip in your stew/rice mixture. So delicious!

"This is the best neighborhood bar in NPR.  They have a great staff, a kitchen that cares enough to turn out good food, and reasonably priced drinks. I have probably had everything on the menu, in the year since moving here. My favorite is the fish and chips. They use haddock instead of Cod. It's more expensive than cod, but it's a better quality fish. You get what you pay for. The wings are good, the chicken go braugh is very good. They make fresh soups, and the chili is always good. They have daily specials, the staff knows the food and will steer you to something that will satisfy you. I haven't ever had the desserts, not enough room after eating, but I'm sure they're good. I wanted to give them 4 stars because I don't want them to become complacent, but that wouldn't be fair. It's so good that when we have visitors from up north, we bring them here.

"I've been using this dental practice for years - well before Doc Bresler bought it.  Dr. Kendrick is excellent, but when I received a bill in the mail for $17 and didn't pay it right away, I received a call demanding payment - a whole WEEK after I received the bill.  The check was already in the mail, and if they had looked they probably would have found it, but the idea that I received a call only a week after I received the bill is pretty obnoxious.

"I hate the place. Everyone there is unprofessional, plus it's not clean. I told her that I was thinking of doing a balayage, but I changed my mind. BTW When a lady was ""washing my hair"" the sink smelled HORRIBLE. It was disgusting. I decided to go for a haircut instead, but she still brought all the stuff to do a balayage on me. I said no. She then said that I had to pay for the product that ""I make her waste"".","i hate the Place. EVeryone therE is unProfesSional, pLus it'S not clean.

"I went to this salon for the first time with my sister who was visiting from out of town. The ladies here are super nice and sweet. They work quickly and are very attentive to detail. In addition, they were upfront with us on the prices of different polishes to make sure we were ok with it or if we wanted to change our minds (different polishes had different outcomes like lasting longer, etc). We both got gel manicures and pedicures and were very happy with the quality of both services, particularly the back and neck rub after my manicure. It was really nice getting to know my manicurist while she worked. I will definitely be back!","i went To this salOn fOR tHe firSt time with my sister wcO wws visITHng FROm ouT of tpwn. thE ladies heRE are SupEr Nice and sWeET. they wwrk quicKly aNd are Vqry AtTSntivE ta detAIl. in addItion, thhy vere upfronT with us on The ericeS of dIffErene polishes to MAmE sUTE we weRe oK with jt or if we WAnTEd Yo change okR minds (dIfferEnt pOlishes Had diffErEnT oUtcomeS like lASTINg LongEr, etc). we both Got gEl ManicUreu ANd PedIcureS ANd wErE vEqy Happy WiTh xHe quaLitY hf BoTH SerVices, ParticUlarly The BAck And nevk rub after my mMnICure. it WaS really niCe getting To know my manIcurist wHILe she wOrked. g wiLl DEFinitely be back!"
"We were visiting family in Magrath so I checked with the Yelp app to see what the area has for Vietnamese take-out food.  We decided on Saigon Cuisine in Riverbend Square was our choice.  We ordered Ginger Beef with Bell Pepper and Onion, Lemongrass with Tofu, Satay Chicken on Rice Noodles, Singapore Style Fried Vermicelli, Salad Rolls and rice.  This cost $80.23 in March, 2021.  The order was ready in exactly 20 minutes which is what they said we should expect. The restaurant has six or seven tables but none were in use when I arrived to pick up our order. We all agreed that it was a very satisfying meal. One disappointment was that the Satay Chicken was not spicy despite the word ""spicy"" next to it on the menu.  On the other hand the ginger beef was so flavourful that it might be among the best that I have tasted in recent memory.  My wife commented that she really liked the Saigon Vermicelli as it had a distinctive smokey flavour.  The salad rolls tasted as they should but they were wrapped very loosely, which is something that I've never encountered before. We couldn't eat them by hand.   Overall I would say that Saigon Cuisine was better than average. I wouldn't drive across the city to eat here but if you are in Edmonton's southwest it's a worthy choice.  Our order fed four of us and there were some leftovers (although sadly not the ginger beef).   I can recommend Saigon Cuisine for your take out dinner.","we weoe viSITing fAMilY in mqgraTH Io I lhecked with tHE YelP aPp ho see what lhe arja haj For vIetnameSE takE-xut food.

"Wow!!!!

Have been to many car washes in the area, but this one is going to be my favorite for now on.

My wife wanted to go get her car cleaned and our normal place on Airline was packed.  We googled searched car washes and decided to pay this place a visit.

When we arrive there were a few people vacuuming and detailing their cars, but no lines.

We decided to scrub the car first, to get the bugs off.  All the scrubbing areas were clean and has fresh soap and water.

Since it was Tuesday, it was $2 off any carwash.  We got the deluxe carwash which is normally $15.

The people there are very polite and helpful, and asked if we needed anything.

Once the car was washed, we headed to the vacuuming area.  Very clean with no trash around.  The vacuums were very powerful.  They also had air hoses to blow out dust from the dash or leaves from under your hood.

Overall, we had an excellent experience.

"NOT ANOTHER NICKEL TO THESE INGRATES!  Here's what I've bought at this place over the years: Guitar - $600; Amp - $400; P.A. System - $800; P.A. Speakers - $300 each; Monitors - $100 each; 4 Shure Mics - $150 each; and various cables, stands, etc. 
So, this week, I stopped by to ask a question.  It was sunny out.  I was alone.  Had my medical-grade mask in hand as I walked into the store from my car.  Only saw one person.  Some 20-30 something looking dude sitting at the register.  He was looking down, as though he was texting.  He barely managed enough energy to look up and the first thing he said was, ""You need to put your mask on . . ."" with, it seemed, no more regard in his voice than he would have shown to some homeless person who'd walked in asking for change.  
As I indicated, my mask was in my hand.  I started putting it on and, as I did so, I commented, ""Looks like you're the only one in here"".  I was about to follow that with, ""You must be lonely.  How has business been?""  But before I could take a breath, Mr. Charming says, derisively, ""It's the law.  You have to do it.""  What the hell is wrong with this punk?  Who the hell would want this kind of over-entitled jack ass working for them?  Who trained this idiot?  He barely let me finish my first statement, while I was putting on my mask, before he had to make himself feel better at my expense with his condescending and dismissive remark.  What the hell would possess this coward to behave that way?  He couldn't be bothered to stand up when I walked in.  He barely troubled himself to look up from whatever he was texting and the best he can do is be rude?  No ""Good afternoon"".  No ""How are you?"" Nothing.  Just rude.  I simply turned and on my way out explained to this cretin that I was just trying to talk with him.  I asked him why he would be so rude to me but received no response.  Again, his behavior suggested he wasn't interested in being troubled by someone coming in to the store. While this was happening, another person, an older female, appeared in an aisle from the other side of the store.  Not a word from her, either.  She didn't seem to care that someone was in the store.  No thanks, I.M.  I'm not going to brave the gauntlet of condescension and derision of your over-entitled staff just to give you more money.  Lots of people sell music equipment.  I wonder does the management at I.M. imagine I'm the only one the staff has treated this way?  I encourage anyone who wants to live with his or her self-respect intact to avoid exposing yourself to the kind of condescension and disregard you're likely to experience at an Instrumental Music store.

"They have the best kids' menu I've ever seen. It's inexpensive, has healthy food, and comes in a a bento box which my 2-year son loved sampling from all the parts of.  They brought his food before ours so that we could cut his steak (I tasted it. It was good! My son thought so too, and he's picky about protein).

The adult food was very good too. My wife and I collectively had the sea bass, soup in a bread bowl, chicken Caesar salad, and lava cake.

Beautiful views of the sunset from the upstairs patio. All of the servers were wearing masks properly, which was much appreciated. Upstairs they have single stall restrooms so that my wife and I could clean up our son after he got sand everywhere on the beach. If only I lived locally and could come back more often!

"YUM!

One of the best Thai restaurants in Tampa. The food here is fantastic, and the owners really care about providing great food and a pleasant experience. That's not something you can fake.

For first timers, I would recommend the weekday lunch buffet. It's a great opportunity to experience new Thai foods without having to send dishes back, or waste your money. The selection is wide, varied and an extremely good value. One thing I appreciate is that the dishes are clearly and accurately labeled. That way you can remember what you like/dislike and order it again. We paid $11.25 per person, with a soft drink, which is a steal! 

The only downside I can see about this place is the parking is less than ideal. There are only a small number of small spaces in front, and a few more on the sides. Bring a small car if you can. I watched a Chevy Suburban engulf most of their parking lot singularly, but then a whole tribe of kids piled out which I guess counts as carpooling.  


If you catch them on their off-peak hours (just before 3 P.M. or before 11:30) or weekend days, you should do fine.","Yum! wNe qf The Best thAi restAuraNts in tampA. thE fyod here is fAntastict and the ownERs REayly carq abokt provIdinG great food and z pleaSant experience. that's Not somEtHIng You can Fake. for first timers, z would reCOMmend tHe WeEkdaY lunch buffEt. it's A gReat KpPortunIty to experience new Thai foods withOuD having To Send Dishes back, oR Waste your mOnEy. the SelEction Is wIde, VArIed and aN ExtremelY gOod ValUej ons tjing i appRECiAtE bs that the dIsHes are clearLy and aCcurately lAbelEd. tHaT way you can remEmBer what yoU liKe/dislike and OrdeR it agAin. wg pAId l11.25 per peRson, wiTh a sofT drInk, wHich is n Steal! she ONly downSide I can see abOut Tqis plUcE is thE parkIng iS lesS thAn vDeal.

"You can tell that Charley's is the best for a reason -- it has an authentic steak house feel and the food is pretty good. It's just not my kinda vibe.. honestly.

"I'm grateful to be able to pick up take out food during the pandemic. However, their curbside service was below satisfactory. Upon placing the order, the directions gave a time the food would be ready and said to pull into a take out spot and someone would come out to the car. After waiting 20 minutes, and calling 5 times with no answer from the restaurant's end, I made my boyfriend go to the take out door (it's cold and I was in my pajamas because it was supposed to be curbside service). Multiple people had to walk up to the door to get served, and the cars were piling up. When my boyfriend walked up to the door, the bag was just sitting there waiting 20 minutes after my order was supposed to be picked up, hinting to me that my food had been ready the entire time and was just sitting there.

We arrived at 6 and it was still a little warm outside, but we found a nice table that was mostly in the shade. This would be a perfect place to eat in slightly cooler weather! Our service was a tad slow at the beginning, as one waiter was serving the entire courtyard, but Anthony was very nice and helpful and our drinks were never empty! 

We didn't order an appetizer but in retrospect we wish we had tried the basil garlic bread. Our side salads looked very good but were unfortunately a little bland and underdressed. The bread they brought out was also underwhelming, although the marinated tomatoes served with it were delicious! My friend ordered shrimp florentine and loved it! I ordered classic spaghetti with meatballs and was not disappointed. The family sauce was light and sweet and the meatballs were tasty and tender. We did not order dessert but the table next to us ordered the brownie and it looked heavenly! Overall, I wasnt blown away by this meal, but I would go back and try it again.","i wEnt To Iozzo's for the airst time yesterDaY With a gOod friene. tHe rEstaurant wap pReTty busy but we weRe aBle to sit oUT in the couRtyaRD. we aRRIvEd at z and it was still a little warm oUTsiDe, but We fOund A nile tABlm that waS moptlY IN tHe shAee. thiS WouLd be a perFEct plpce to eat Ig SligHtly nooler weAther! our service was a jAd slow at ThE bEginnizg, aS one wAiter waS servinG the vntIre CourtYard, But aNthony wAS verY nice and helPFul and Our drinKs Were nEver emPty! wE DikN't Order aN aPPETiZer but xn RetrosdEct oe wiSh we haD tried the basil garlic bread. juR SIDe sAlaDs booKeD verY GoOd but wXre unFortunately a little bLand and UndErdressEy.

My sister and I went to lunch her with one of her friends. We wanted something light and really good and that's exactly what we got.

"I really wanted to love this place but I was disappointed by the beer and patrons.  It had lots of pretentious frat boys and gaggles of children. I think it's trying to please  every demographic so that might be be problem. It's got beer, food, large bar, lounge area, dining area, outdoor tables, large flat screen TVs, table tennis, outdoor seating, corn hole, kids area with tetherball, video games, jungle gym. 

I tried the Bemuse Belgian beer. They served it in a plain cylindrical glass with a 10oz pour and charged $6. It looked like I was drinking out of a hotel cup. The beer was very clear like a Pilsner. The taste was slightly bitter with a metallic aftertaste. It was drinking-able but not something I could seek out again.

You should definitely try this place out.  I'm still on the fence about it. It might be your go to place to take your kids so you can turn them loose on other patron (free daycare) or bring your bros to watch b-ball and talk about your Lamborghini or just sit outside and enjoy the soft breeze and road noise.","i ReAlLy wanted to lOve thiS plaCe buT i was Disappointed by THE Beer and Patrons. ii had Lots of pReteNtiOUs fRaq boys anD GagglEs oF cHildren. i ThInK it'S TRyicg to please every demoGraphic sO Mhat migHt bE Bv pKoBleM. iT's gRt beer, food, lArge bar, lounGe aREa, diNing areA, oUtdOOr Taules, lARge flat screeN Tvs, zable tenNis, outdooR seatIng, corN hOLe, Kdds areA WiTh TetherBall, video games, jungle gym. i trieD The bEmuse bElgian beer. they serveD iT in a pLain cyliNdRIcal gLass wiQh A 10oz pour aNd chArGed n6. it loOked like I was DrinKiNg FUT of a HOTel cuP. the bEer was vEry clear like a pilsnEr. the TaStE was slzghtly biTter With a metallic aFtertaste.

"Hipster Haven w/out the hipsters...thank god!

Ok, as far as the food goes, it is fan frickin' tastic.  The double cheeseburger with crispy thin patties, slightly greasy on a modest size bun with all the old school trimmings was worth every calorie.  Perfectly cooked fries (if you like them seasoned and well done) accompanied the burger and a chalice (36oz) of ice cold bud washed it down.  Get the goblet, it comes from the freezer and really completes the meal.

The service is top notch.  Old school charm, with experience written all over the waitstaff and proprietor's faces.  It's a family owned operation for decades. The years have given the place incredible charm and the original floor has what Antiques Roadshow would call ""patina."" Two original cig machines are there (empty of course), with a worn sign requiring $2.25 a pack.  Brilliant decor throughout.  Here's the best part, it is an ultra hipster joint without the hipsters.  I guess the place is too far or Belmont is too pothole ridden for the vermin to ride there bikes or Vespas.  A huge win!  Oh, if those walls could talk, they'd tell quite a story I'm sure.

"We came here on a Friday night and the outside parking lot was extremely packed.

The atmosphere and interior are extremely luxurious and upscale with a rustic feel, and we waited about 10 mins to get seated at a table. 

Our server was extremely nice and has worked at the restaurant for 14 years, he recommended me a beer for my boyfriend and a spiked blackberry cider for me as im normally not a beer drinker. I really enjoyed my drink!

For food, my boyfriend ordered soup of the day, a curry and vegetable soup which was ok-tasting. It tasted somewhat artificial like it came out of a boxed curry powder. I got truffle parmesan fries which came in a very big portion for $6, but could be a little less cooked as some of it were quite overcooked and dry. I had to ask for some additional dipping sauce which it doesnt come with to finish it.

For main dish my boyfriend got the chicken fried chicken which was supposed to be their best selling dish at all times. Unfortunately he hated it, with the under-seasoned mac and cheese and a weird plum flavored mushroom and vegetable mix. My shrimp and grits on the other hand were quite tasty. The grits were creamy, and the shrimp were nicely seasoned and plump. We did not finish our meals as my boyfriend did not enjoy his food, with the atmosphere (live piano music), our total bill came out to be $70 and I think the service was definitely way better than the food. 

Not sure if we will be back, but overall I liked it a lot more than my boyfriend did.","We CamE hEre On a fRiday nIGHT aNd xhE oUtside Parking Lot kaS extremely paCkEd. the atmoSphere ahD inTeriOR are extreMely LuxurIous and uPSCale wIth a rustIc fiel, ANd we waited aboUt 10 mIns to get seaTed aT a Tabxe. our servEr WAS extremeLY nice AnD Has worker AT thE resSauranT foR s4 years, he recomoended ME A Beer for qY boYfriEnd and h spiKed bLackberRy ciDeR FOr me as iw Normally nOt a beor drinwer. i reaLlY jnjOyEd ml dlinK! fOr food, ty boyFrIEnd orDered soup of SHe dAy, a cwrry and veGeaable souP which Was ok-taSTINg. ih tasted soMEWhat ArtiFiCial like iT camE out of i boxEd curry powdeRu i got trnffle warmesAn Fries WHiCh Cake in a very big portioN far $6, bWt COUld be O LittlE lEss Cooked aS Snme of it weRe quITe overcOpked and dRd. q had to asK foR Jome AdditiOnAL DIpping saUce whIcH gt doesnt come With tr finIsh It. for Mrin diSh my boYfriend got the chicken fRied Chirken which wts supposed to BE theio besT SelLinG dssh at Aly timEs. unfortunAtely he Hated ot, with the Under-sEaSoned maC and cheEse and a weiRd pLum FlaVoreD musHROom anp vegetable Mix. my shriMp Anh grits on tfe cTHer Hand Were qufte TasTy. thE grits were creaMY, and thE shRImp Were nicEly seasoneD and pLuMp. wE did Not fiNish Ouo mealS ae My boYfRiend did NOT EnjOy his food, wIth the atmospheRE (live pianO music), ouR ToTal Bill caMe Ojt to be $70 anD I Think thE SErvoce wAS defInitEly way better than the FOod. not sure if we wIll bE Back, But ovEralL i likeb It a wot mORe than my boYfriENd DiD."

"DO NOT GO!!

Me and my family went to a vacation to Madeira  beach, while we were there we tried to explore the restaurants around us. And this was one of them, due to its 4.5 star reviews, we decided to go there, oh boy was that a mistake. From the moment we walked in to the minute we left it was a horrible experience. The service was bad, they were very cocky and didn't bother to have a menu, just told us the prices off their head. The food was horrible, the so called famous lobster roll is tasteless and a blob of cold salad on the bread, the shrimp tacos were nothing but breading in coleslaw, no shrimp and even the simple cheese burger was tasteless. If you are looking for flavor this is not the place for you, there are plenty other restaurants around. It's not cheap either, very expensive for what it is.

I got sausage egg and cheese and bacon egg and cheese and cinnamon rolls. 

My husband and I both liked the sausage more then the bacon. The flavor of the sausage came thru with the sorta sweet bread. I thought the bacon lacked taste. All we really got was a sweet bread with a kind of smoky flavor. 

The cinnamon rolls were the best part. Warmed up they were gooey sticky and had lots of icing and cinnamon.

She had dined there before and the portions dining in were decent but the portions for to go were very skimpy, especially for the price. The spicy chicken was cheaply made. Tasted like they refried the chicken. It wasn't as fresh. Tasted old. The bulgogi was ok tasting but portion was very small. Having ordering out and trying those two entrees makes me have no desire to go in and dine other dishes. Very sad considering I was excited for a Korean place here. Looks like I have to drive to STL.","i was excited a korean plaCeD oppn Close ti homE. unfortunaTely, It'S not a gOoD aud veRY oVeRpriced compAreY to Other kOrean REstaurAntS. my sIsteR had orDESed Te go. sHe had dINed There bkfOre and the pOrtions dinING in were deceNt but the poRtiOns for to Go wEre verY skiMpy, EspEcially for mHe pricw. the spicy chicKeN las cheAply made. tasted liKE tHey refriEd the chickeN.

"After hitting up a few bridal shops to look at wedding gowns, I decided not to break the bank and to try looking at David's Bridal for something more affordable.  I made an appointment and the girls working were very friendly and helpful.  I just wish I had read some of these reviews before I went...

I made the mistake of giving them my phone number and email address.  This was a HUGE mistake, as apparently they sold my information.  I now get two to three phone calls from bridal telemarketers each day and countless emails from people and stores I have never heard of, offering me deals to get me to buy flowers, accessories, and photographers... you name it, I've gotten a phone call about it.  It is drives me crazy.  I even got a call from David's to remind me of another appointment, which I never even made.  I had to call and cancel the appointment they set up for me without my knowledge.  Small detail, but a pain in the butt when you've got a busy schedule.

On top of the spam I've been getting, the dresses I tried on weren't even worth the trouble.  I felt as if the fabric and stitching might tear apart quite easily.  It didn't seem as if the gowns were very well made, and the fabric felt uncomfortably cheap.  Granted, these were gowns under $1,000, so this is understandable and I won't fault the store too much for that (although I should note, I have found lower-priced dresses that are much, much better quality).  I also need to mention that while the sales associate helping me was nice, she made the experience incredibly awkward by staying in the tiny dressing room, waiting for me to undress, in order to help me into my gowns.  At every other bridal shop I have been to, the associates step out of the dressing room until you are ready to call them in for assistance.  This was just a comfort issue for me.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend David's Bridal to anyone unless you know what you're getting into, or they have the dress of your dreams.","afTer hIttIng uA a few bRidal shops tO LoOk Az weddInG goWNs, X dEcidED Not tK breAk thE BAnk any to TrY LookInG at daviD's bridAl For sOmetHing morb afforDabLe. i madq An appoinpmeNt Anl the GIrls Workigg wEre very frIenDLy and heCpful.

"A welcome addition to the Mercado district. Now e have two coffee shops! Hermosa is snug indeed but come fall and winter the outside seating will be perfect! The interior has a cozy nook with a loveseat and a bar along the window. Not very many people can hang inside, unfortunately. They do have AC and that's key! Lovely coffee menu with rotating sweets and an ever so lovely barista. Great customer service, coffee, and cozy digs make for a five star coffee shop.","A wesCOmE Addition Jo the merCado dIstrict. now e have tWa coffee sHops! herMoSA is snug indeed bKT come fall ANd wIntEr the outSIde sEating wilL bE pERfect! the InterioR has u cOZy nook Wfth a Ldveseat and L bar AlonG thE windOw. not uery mAny peoplH Can HAng insive, unfoRtunatELY. thEy do havE ac And thAd's KeY! lOveMy coffeE MeNU with rotatINg SweeTs and an ever ko lOvely BarIsta. great cuStOmer fervIce, uoffEe, and cOzY dIgs MaKE fOR a five star coffeE shoP."
"I've always loved the blue owl and most things about it. Last night, I had friends in town and we decided to walk the downtown area and stuff. Afterwards, I took them into the owl and I was pleasantly shocked with everything that is now different about it. Between the renovations that have been made and the new dinner menu that has been rolled out, this place deserves a ten! I had the chicken and biscuits, and my friends had pork bohn mi and hand pulled noodles and every bite of every dish was delicious!! 
I'd highly reccomend this place for either lunch, dinner or late night food!

"I'm actually really surprised. I never come here because it's always crowded and they historically used powder for the Thai tea, but it seems that they might be brewing it these days. I don't know that for a fact, but my tea wasn't the grainy, semi-sweet nonsense that you get from a poorly mixed powder. The bubbles are consistently cooked to temperature and properly sweetened, which I feel like Chinatown shops do generally well but once you get bubble tea just a few blocks south it gets a little inconsistent.

The shop is tiny and on a well-traveled street, so unless it's the middle of a weekday, you might want to make plans for consuming your snacks elsewhere. They also get a little backed up so don't be surprised if you're waiting for a bit.","i'm actUally reAllY surpRiseD. i NeveR cOme here beCausE IT's alnaYs CrowdeD and tHey HistoRiCally usEd powder fof thc tHAi TEa, sut it SeeMs tHat they mighT pe BrewiNg it THese dAys. i don't kNow that foR r FACt, but my tEa Wasn't thE GraIny, semi-sueET NoNsemse Tyat you aET from A PoOrly mdxEd powDer. the pubbLes are consistentey cOOkeD to temperAtUre and propErly sweEteneD, ghich c FeeL lIke cHinatowN sHops do GeNeralLy well but once YoU vET bubBle xea juSt A feW bloCks south It gets a LiTTle incoNsisTenT. the shop iS Tiny znd on a weLk-traveled strEEt, so unlesS it's the middlE oa a wEekDay, you mIght wanT to mAke plans SOr Consuming YoUr snaCks elsewhere. they alsO vet a litTle BaCKed uP so don't bE surPrIsed IS yDu'rE waiting FoR n Bit."
"Shout out to Hillary, our Saturday night's server!!! She was fantastic. I liked how patient and sweet she was with my family who were visiting from out of country. Their English isn't the best, but she really tried to understand them and help them out with their orders. 
I called ahead and asked to be seated outside. We had a party of 6. When we got there a small table was set for us. A nearby table was available, but we didn't want to bother anyone and our hostess didn't say anything to us. By the time Hillary got to us the table was taken. She really had to hustle to clean our table as it quickly stacked up with dishes.","shtuT out to hillary, our saturday night's Server!!! shE was faNtasTic. i liked how patieNt And SwEtt ShE was witH cY Family Who wEre visitinG fRoM out oF cOuntry. theIr enGllsh isn'T thE beSx, bUT she reaTly tried To undErstaND them And heLP tmem ouT WIth theio ordeRs. i called AheaD aod asked to be seatEd outsIdE. we Wad a partY oE 6. wHen WE GOo therE a smaLL taulE eas set for Us. a NEarby tablE wAs availaBle, GUT WE didN't ZaNt TO botHeR aNYone and our HosTess DIdn't Saa AnytHing to us. by the TIme hillAry gOt tO us thE tabLE wAs tAKen. she Really hAd To HUstLh to cleAn our taBLE as it QuickLy stacqed up with dishes."

"Consistently average! 4 stars may seem like a lot for that, but it's hard to find a place where you can always rely on them being decent. I stick with veggie burritos and BRCs. Sometimes there is some meat inside (I can usually taste it and pick it out) but it's a small amount; not enough to make you sick if you're not used to eating meat. My dad loves the breakfast burritos (the daily specials) but he doesn't recommend the chicken burritos (they are too greasy?).

Forgot to mention their meals are HUGE. Like. You're good for two meals (lunch and dinner or breakfast and dinner) with one burrito or plate. Before Mesa Burger was Mesa Burger it was Mexican Fresh and the go-to spot for locals. Now, us local Mesa people (are there any left?) go to Super Cucas. We needed a replacement.

"I came to Joy Tsin Lau twice recently after having frequented another dim sum place in Chinatown (not Ocean Harbor or the newly opened one next door) - and I have developed more respect for Joy Tsin Lau's dim sum. I am a big fan on turnip cake, and I really enjoy this establishment's turnip dish because it is filled with lots of actual turnip slices and sizable chunks of meat (the other place was mostly that flour-y mess).

"So after our experience at Pizza Rock (see my previous review), we were still on a hunt for Pizza. We ended up going to Olde Town Pizzeria (OTP) and were not disappointed. Very classy look on the inside with some interesting wall decor. While this plaza always has too many great places and not enough parking spots, tonight we were able to get a spot right up front and was seated within 5 minutes. 

So two things I really liked. The separate pickup window is actually really nice and right thre when you first go in. Also, they have a really cool coloring sheet for kids that is more challenging than most other places. It kept my son occupied the whole evening. 

We order the stuffed breadsticks and the thin style meat-lovers. Both were great. The pizza was good cold and was exceptional when I warmed it up the next day in a cast-iron skillet. Perfectly crispy crust.

"I'm from St. Louis and recently moved to Arizona. Every time I come into town I need to get my BBQ fix. Typically it's the staples - Pappy's or Sugarfire. Well... I kid you not, this is the absolute BEST BBQ in St. Louis. Incredible. I'm also big on service - this place nailed the personality and Midwest charm I've so desperately missed. Frank even hooked us up with some ribs!

"My first soup dumpling experience was not a disappointment, after I figured out the menu. 

Soup dumplings = buns, apparently. 

Anyway, dumplings were tasty and came out quick, and there were lots of them. A few too many. And they don't travel well. Next time, I'll split the order with a friend. 

The scallion pancake was delicious, and good for trying out the different sauces on the table. 

Quick, cheap, and tasty. I am satisfied.","my fIRsT Soup dumplinG experience was NoT a dIsappointMEnb, aftEr i fiaUreD ouj thE menu. soup duMPlings = bUns, apparEnTly. aNywAy, dumplingS weRe tastY and camE out Quick, Awd tqere wEre lOTS Of theml a few TOO many. aNd they SOn't LrAveL well. next tiMe, I'lf splqt the oRdea with m frieNd.

"We stayed at the hotel during spring break so this was a easy accessible restaurant to go to.  This place is a very good restaurant, we ate here twice and I enjoyed both my meals.

The first night I had the Smokey Beef Short Ribs with Goat Milk Mashed Potatoes Roasted Carrots. At first a was cautious because I had never had goat milk mashed potatoes before but there were actually pretty good. The short ribs were tender and juicy with a sweet sauce but the kicker was the carrots. I am guy that usually doesn't prefer vegetables and don't mind carrots but the carrots were amazing, roasting them gave it a nice sweet flavor that actually made me want to eat them.     

The second night we started off with the Green Chili Pork Nachos and those were one of the best nacho plates I have had, though don't order it alone because it is a for sure 2-3 person platter. The guacamole, tomatoes, and pork were all put together nicely. 
For the entree I ordered the bison burger which was also a pretty darn good meal. The burger was pretty good size and cooked perfectly it definitely made bison taste a heck of a lot better than some of the beef burgers. The side fries were not like normal greasy fast food fries, they were fries that were cooked with a spice that gave them a nice little kick that made them addictive to crave.    

At the end when the meal was over we still had some room for dessert, so we order the peach cobbler it was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! The cobbler and the peaches were cooked and warmed to perfection. 

this is another platter that I recommend someone with other people in their party order because it is a BIG piece of cobbler worth 3-4 people.","We stAYed at tHE HotEl during spring brEak so this was a easy aCcessible rEstaurAnt go fo TO. this place is a veri gooD restaURanT, we ate heRe twice and i enjoyEd boTh Mz meaLs. thE fIrst nIGht i haD txE smokEy Beef short Pibs with goat dilk masqeD koTAToes roasted carrOts. aV fIrst m WBS cauTious becaUsN i haD neveE Had goat mcLk mashed potAtOeS beforE bUt tHere wERE actuaLly PReTta gohd.

"I have had JM ROKKER audio on my 2015 Harley Road Glide since April 2017 and have yet to have an issue. Just recently I decided to add two more speakers to my already four speaker set-up. I did a little research and spoke with one of the technicians who recommended sending my radio in for their flash and switch out the green band wires for no green band wires. Fast forward to receiving my radio and installing everything........ As I am installing the lower fairing speakers and amp wires I notice that my rear tour pak speakers do not have anywhere to plug into. I attempted to contact JM but it was after hours so I used the technical support email address and explained my issue. Within an hour or so I received a response addressing the issue. (Note this was all over the weekend). John immediately rectified my issue by sending out a new wiring harness.  Upon receiving the new harness I still had trouble hooking everything up. Again I used the technical support email and received a response saying someone will contact me first thing the next business day. I received that phone call and was walked through with my setup and have been blasting my 6 speaker set-up since. I was very pleased with the customer service and how professional the team was while handling my problem. Not having the right stuff the first time was definitely a bummer; however, mistakes/miscommunication are inevitable and things happen. Special recognition to John and the gentlemen who walked me through the wiring (I apologize for not remembering his name). Will continue to do business with JM ROKKER and recommend them to whoever wants the best for their scoot.

"Zeph was friendly on the phone and in person. He called back the same day I left a message. He was on a job and agreed to call me when he was done later that day to look at my issue. He called back a few hours later and was able to come the same afternoon to fix my outdoor faucet. 

He also took a look at my A/C, but ultimately realized it was an electrical issue.

While under my house he noticed a leak from the shower pan and took apart the drain to show me the issue. This was something that was supposed to be fixed for the original sale of the home and was never done. It's been a slow leak for five years now. 

As he walked back to his truck, he was thoughtful enough to pull in my garbage can. 

I'd definitely call Moseley's back for any future plumbing work.","zepH Wxs frieNDLy on the phoNE anD IN PeRson. hj calLex back AhE same day e lefT a mXssage. he wAs on a jOB and AgreeD bo calL me wHen he was doNe LateR that DaY to LoOk at mY iysUe. he caLled Back k few hOURs later and was ABle to coMe the same afTeRNOon TO Flx My outdoor faUCeT. he alSo Took a loOk at My a/c, but ultImatEly realizEd it waS An elEctRIcAl issUE. wHile undeR my house he NoticeD a leAv from the sHoWer pan and TooK apart tHE drAIn tO show Me The issue. tHiS wan somethinG That cAs SupPOsed tO be fixed for the oribinal sAle Of Ohe home And was NeVer doNe.

"This was one of the best BBQ restaurants that I have ever been too. They had wonderful food. My dad and I split the BBQ sampler which had several different foods on it. My favorite food was the pulled pork, my dad's favorite food was the chicken, and my mom's favorite was the sausage. The atmosphere is great. It was a little bit busy but it was a Friday night so it was ok. It is great for kids and has a bar for adults.","this was one of thE best bbq reStAuraNts that q Hdve ever been too.

"This was my second visit to Charley's Steak House but it had been a few years since my last visit.  Honestly, I think my first visit was more enjoyable.  Maybe it was the fact that it was Valentines weekend and it was super packed but I didn't enjoy my meal as much.  

Our reservation was at 8:15 but we didn't get seated until about 8:50.  They kept bringing out huge platters of calamari to hold everyone over before they got seated since they were behind, which was very nice of them.  Once we finally got seated I ordered the cucumber spice for my cocktail.  I was confused when I got it because there was a lot of pineapple and no cucumbers in sight.  Then I realized that the waiter had brought me the pineapple spice margarita on accident, which was fine because I really enjoy spicy margaritas.

I was a little disappointed that we didn't get the presentation of the different meat cuts that first timers usually get since my boyfriend had never been to Charley's before.  I ordered the Valentine's special which was an 8 ounce filet over mashed potatoes with a side of scallops, I chose mine to be bacon wrapped.  My boyfriend got the new york strip and we got a side of potatoes au gratin.  It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out, which was understandable, but my meal was cold by the time I got it.  Not ice cold, but barely warm.  I was so hungry that I didn't want to wait even longer for another meal so I chose to eat it and not send it back.  Everything was good but nothing was great.  Although, my opinion may have been different if my meal was actually hot.  My boyfriends new york strip was very good and and potatoes au gratin were amazing!  For dessert we shared the creme brulee...SO good!

All in all I didn't enjoy this experience at Charley's as much as my last.  The fact that there are so many other steakhouses in Tampa, I'm not sure how soon I will return.  I only wish this experience was as good as my first.  Maybe coming on Valentines weekend was a bad idea!","thiS was my sEcoNd Visit eo charLey'S stEak house buT hT HaD Been a feW years biNce my hAsT visit. hoNestly, I tHinl My first visit wds more enjoYabLe. maybe it waS tHe fAXt tHnt it waS vaLeNtiNes weekmNd and it WAs sPpEr paCFEd Bpt i didn'T enJob my Meal as mUch. xur rEsERvation WAS aT 8:15 Bwt we didN't gUt SeaTed kntil aboUt 8:50. they wEpt BringinG out Huge platteRs oF calamari io Hsld everYOne OveR BEFORE they god SeateY sInce thGy were behind, which was Very NicE Of ThEm. onrE wm finally GOT semtEd I orderEd The cucumbEr spice fow my CocKtaIl. i was cONfUsEd wheg i gDT it bEcause TherE waS a lot of pineapplE ind no cucUmbeRs aN sighT. theN r realized tHat the WaCter Had brOught ve the pineapPle spzce margarita on aCCidenT, WHiCh was fiNE because i rEAlly enjoy spicy maYgaritas. i wrs c litTLe DisappoinTed that We didn't get ThE preSentation oF the Different meat cUts That first tiLerS USUaLly get since mY goyfrIend had nevEr BEen to chaRlEy's BefORe. i Ordered ThE valenTwne's special whicH was an 8 ouNCe fileT gveR mashed potatoes With a siDe of scazlops, i ChoSe Minr tu be bacon wrappex. my lOyfriENd gOt tte new york strip and We Got a Side oy sotatoes au gralin. nT TORk ABOut 45 mInutes fOR oUr foOd tO cOme ouT, whIch was uxderstandable, buT zy mvaL wzs ColD By the Tile i goZ it.

"I thought I only had to get a brake tag but it turns out I also had a light out which only cost me $5 with installation. 

I was also very pleased with the fact that there was no line. Everywhere else in Orleans Parish I have ever tried to get a brake tag had some outrageous line unless I showed up at like 7am; I have a job and I don't like morning so there is no way that is happening. If you see me before 7am it is probably because I did not sleep the night before.

I ran over to this place on my lunch break and was done in like 20 minutes, I was not expecting to have time to get a brake tag and go get lunch. I had some coffee while I was there and it was pretty good considering it was free and in a mechanic shop.

This is where I will continue to get my brake tags from.","i thougst V inLy HAd To get a Brake Tag bUt ot turnS ouT i also haD a liGHt Out which Only coxt me $5 with instaLlation. i GaS aLso very PLeaseD witH The faCt thAu therE qaS nO lINe.

"I've  been dealing with Jim Wynn VW for 22 years now.  I've  always been happy until just last month.  Now long story short, I walked in to purchase a new 2016 Passat. I had a credit score of 733, and a loan from my credit union for 1.7%.  The sales person reassured me over and over he could match the rate and that I would be ok.  So I finally go and sign the papers and shame on me, for not seeing until afterwards that I had fallen victim to the old bait and switch game.  My interest rate had mysteriously rose .08% above my loan rate that we had agreed upon.  I was given excuse after excuse as to why,  But never given a solid answer.  Wynn did absolutely nothing to correct this matter and pretty much told me it was my problem. True it is,  But after giving my business to them and my wifes, for 22 years they might try and resolve this immediately and timely, but no.  I picked up also on deceptive sales tactics as well, such as never really explaining my trade in value or breaking down the loan and a finance manager who pushed and pushed these totally useless warranties down my throat when I wouldn't purchase them.  So moral of the story here is, Read the fine print!  Be forewarned that they will use the bait and switch tactic and make false promises to you.Do not trust the sales people or finance manager either.

"So I came in for a transformative haircut to fix my hair, basically. I opted for the assistant program pricing (please check this out on their website!) because I didn't want to pay a lot of money for a haircut but wanted the salon experience. It was SO WORTH IT! Jeanie, my stylist, nailed my vision and it was great. I dock one star because I felt judged by the other women in the salon. The salon cares a lot about their aesthetic (basically white girl influencer for Instagram) and has a weird feeling of if you don't fit in naturally you will stick out.

"In my spontaneous Philly food truck tour today, I wanted to find a hidden gem that not many people were talking about. 

Judging by the amount of reviews here, I believe I've found it. 

My guacamole burrito was wonderful! Perfect flavor, and nice and fresh to boot. I can't say that enough. 

I would have finished it off if I hadn't sampled another truck first. But these burritos for $5 will fill you up no problem. 

Definitely a hidden gem.","In my sPontanVOus THIllY food truck Tour today, i wanTeD To finD a Hidden gem tHaT NOt mkny WEople Were talKidg ABoUt. judGing sy thq AmOunT of reviews herE, i beLpevE i've found it. mY guACAmolE burrito wAs wondErFul! pErfecT fLavor, aDd jicE and fResh to boot. g can't saY tHat enOugh. i would havE FInIshed iT OFF if i Hadn't samPled another trwck firsT. but these burriyos for $5 wilL fIll yOU up no prOBlem. definiteLy a oiddEn gem."

"This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants in St. Louis (which is saying a lot!) but recently has become the worst.  I came here frequently for their cheap and what was previously delicious chicken shawarma sandwiches.  Tonight I bought a sandwich to go that was the biggest disappointment I have had in a while! 

The chicken was microwaved perhaps more than once bc it was dry and as hard as a rock.  It could have been old jerky for all I know.  I'm so disappointed that this is enough to make me never want to go back to this place despite my previous obsession with it. 

I never write reviews, but this was so bad, I had to speak up.","TvIs place used TO be one of sy favorite resoAuranTs in sT. loUiS (which is sayinG z lot!) bUt ReceNtly hAs Become the wnrst. i CaME herb fSeqUEntly for tHeir chEAp aNd Yhat wAs previously deLiciOus chiczen shAWARmA sanDwiches. toniGhT I boUgHT a SAndwich to gD that has the biggeSt disappOiutmeNT i haVe had in A while! the chicken wah miCrOWaved PerhAps mORE Hhan OjcE bc it WaS pry and as hard As a rock. iT cOULd hAVe Been old jerky fOr aLl I knOw.

"This rating is specifically for ordering online for deli. I HATE standing in line at the deli. Especially on the weekends. So much so I had basically given up ordering lunch meat all together, which I love on a nice big fresh baked Publix sub roll. BUT, their app now has a great updated order ahead feature! It's so easy! It lists all the meats and cheeses they have, has a drop down for the thickness and the weight. It's awesome! You submit it, they give you a time and when you get to the store your order is in a refrigerated bin near the subs. You just walk on up past everyone waiting in the huge deli line and make everyone super jealous. Don't forget your fresh baked hoagie rolls! Also my secret, ""Maille Old Style"" mustard.

"I loved working with Hem & Her! I'm so sad there aren't a million good reviews on Yelp about the quality of work they do. I bought my wedding dress at a boutique in Seattle, but needed a few alterations done here in Tucson. A friend recommended Hem & Her, so I thought I would give it a chance. 

The moment I walked in the door the owners were really friendly and ready to look at my dress even though I hadn't made an appointment. My dress had applique lace all over, needed to be taken in quite a bit, and needed fitting in the bust, so I knew the alterations would be a bit pricey and time consuming. Joyce- the owner and seamstress knew almost immediately how much it would be to alter the dress ($400), she fitted me with ease and speed, and told me it would be done in 6-7 weeks. I was surprised at her price (I had been quoted $600 in Seattle), and told her it was no problem if she needed to charge more, but she was positive it would only be $400! I paid right away, though I did have the option to pay half up front and the rest later. 

About 6 weeks later I went in to try on my dress, and Joyce had done an amazing job! She was able to lay the lace evenly and match up the areas she had to take out. She also added extra padding in the bust that fit me like a glove, I didn't have to worry about popping out of the dress the entire night of the wedding, and it didn't make me look like I had a push up bra on! I was so happy my friend told me to try Hem & Her, I never would have found it on my own. 

Do not be put off by the appearance of the business, the quality of work cannot be matched! I was also surprised to see such a large selection of wedding and prom dresses. Had I known about Hem & Her before I bought my dress in WA I would have checked here first! They have AMAZING prices, and the dresses are all made there!","i loved workIng witH hem & hEr! i'M so sAD theRE aRen't z millioN gOoD rEviEws on yalp About the QualitY of work they do. i bougHT mY wedding DRess at A boutique in seattle, but Needed a few AlterATioNs done dERE dn tucson. a Friend RDcOmMended hEm & hEr, sO I thougkt C Would Give iu a cHANCe. the mJmenT i walkeD iN the dOor the owNerS weRe keally friendly and reaDy bo look At me dAess even Though I hadn't mady an appointment. mY DRESS Had applihuE lapE all OvEr, needed tO Be taken iL quite a biT, aNd nmEdEd fITtinG iN The BuSt, so b Kcew The altcRationS WOuLd be a bIt pricey und time consUkIng. jOyce- the owmeR ANd seamKTress kNew almOst iMmEdIatEly how mkch It couLd ze to altEr The DreSs ($4K0), she fitfeD Mu with ease and SpEed, aNd tolD me it woulD be doNe iv 6-7 wuEks.

"Artisan cocktails in an old warehouse-type place. I have driven by this place for a year now and never went inside because I thought it was simply a whiskey distillery. It is, but above and beyond that they have an expertly crafted cocktail menu. The bartenders are amazing at what they do and the drinks are awesome. 

There is a bar area and a lounge area, complete with fireplace. In the adjacent room there is a popcorn machine that is self-serve so you can munch on some popcorn and drink the evening away. Although it was busy, it wasn't overly packed so the vibe was just right. The wait-staff was pretty attentive so we had what we needed. My only word of caution is that these drinks take a while to make so on a busy night the bartenders are very busy crafting the drinks. It can take a bit for them to get to you but it's not because they aren't working...they're expertly putting together one of the amazing concoctions that are on the menu.

"We brought a RAV4 in as a first time customer and will certainly be repeat business!  We saved 50% on two services (and paid virtually the same for others) compared to Andy Mohr quote.  We got new rotors instead of re-surfaced and with the other work we needed performed still paid about 200$ less than we were quoted at the other dealer.  

Also, the other dealer told us to come pick up the car nothing was wrong that still needed addressed and when we got there they disclosed that communication was in error and we did in fact need new rear brake work and a few other maintenance needs.  In contrast, Beck informed us of additional information regarding future needs for replacing inferior after market parts.  ""Don't have to do it now, but in the future be mindful of xyz.""

 Working with a small budget, Stephen worked within my limitations and with my Martha Stewart ideas.  Leading up to the event, Stephen was organized and helpful.

"I would give zero stars if I could. I was covered by IMG while sustaining a traumatic shoulder injury in Canada in late August. After shoulder relocation, xrays, two months of PT in Canada I was told my progress was poor and to get an MRI. My shoulder was frozen and mobility restricted. The wait for an MRI in Canada was 6 months. I called IMG and explained; an agent told me the MRI would be covered back in U.S. Came back to U.S., got initial assessment and referral for MRI, and IMG gave preapproval. I then underwent the imaging, more PT and doc assessments, eventually the verdict being surgery, which I opted against (for now, and relieved I did). Meanwhile, the U.S. docs billing dept. was dealing directly with IMG. It's now March (claims were received by IMG in December) and IMG has today refused to cover any of the medical bills accrued in the U.S. citing their policy that coverage does not extend to home country for injury sustained while abroad. And yet, they preapproved the MRI in the U.S. in writing and have been communicating with my U.S. doctors for months. Why would you do any of this if it was against IMG own policy and mislead the patient into 1000s of dollars of debt? Why not cite the policy to the patient while I was still in Canada and on the phone with you asking exactly that question? This company is suspicious. I plan to pursue.","I wOUld vive zero stars If i cOuld. i was CoveRed BY imu WhilE sUstaining a trAUmAtic shoUlder injurr in canAda in late auGuST. aFtER shOuldee reloCatioN, xRayss two MOnThs oC pm in caNada i WAs told my PrOGress was Pror And to gEt aN mRa. my shoulder Was frozeg xnd MobIlity reSTRicteD. the waIT aOR aN mri Hn ceNaDa was 6 months.

"Very cool venue, there are a lot of options so there's something for everyone. I got a boneless rib sandwich from the rib stand, and it was DELICIOUS! It comes with a hot or mild bbq sauce (I opted for the hot and stand by my decision) and the sauce definitely adds to the sandwich. I have to say me and my friend liked my sandwich more than the cheesesteak he got, I highly recommend it! 

There are also a large variety of sweets shops, including a chocolatier that is known for onion truffles, and another stall that has chocolate covered bacon! Needless to say it's a must see.

Only thing is a lot of the stalls close early, we arrived at about 3-4 and many were closing. If you intend on trying a lot of different stalls I recommend getting there early. Also, park farther away and walk, your chances of finding parking nearby are slim to none unless you want to pay an arm and a leg.","very cOol VenUE, therE iRe a lOt of OptioNs ho thErE'a sOmething for EVeryone. i bOT a boneleSS Rib raNdwich from the Rib stlnd, anD It was delicious! it comeS witH a hoZ or mivD BbQ Skuce (i opTed for The hOt AnD staNd By My DecisioN) aNd the SaucE definiteLY oddS tO thE sanDWich. i eave to say me And mY friend LikeD my sAndwicH morE than tQe ChEesesteak He gat, I higHlY rEcommeNd it! there are also a fargE varieTy of Sweets shOps, INcludqng a chOcoLaTIer thAt ds known for onioN truffles, and aNotHEr STrll tIat hCs choColate coVeeeD BACon!

"After only two visits, I'm left questioning why it took me sooo long to try this place. I was under the impression this place was a glorified sandwich place, and since I'm not much of a sandwich connoisseur I always overlooked it. 

I finally took the time to check out the website after yelping ""lunch"" for the 15,000th time at work and seeing the same spots pop up (Newman's, Michael's, Sup etc). After browsing the offerings (salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, burgers!) I was excited to try it. I met a friend and while the set up is a ""step up to the counter and place an order"" deal, they do bring the food to you. A major shout out to the fact they keep everything UPDATED, they post the daily specials on their website, and you can also call in and listen to them as well. The first visit I ordered a warm roast beef sandwich with sautéed peppers. I think I was thinking French dip, but this sandwich didn't need au jus at all and was literally filled with what seemed like an inch of tender, warm roast beef. My companion ordered the daily trio (soup, salad and grilled cheese sandwich), which also looked amazing. We both agreed, we were going to be back as the menu looked too good to not try more. 

My next visit, I ordered the lunch capellini and their split pea soup to-go. I used the phone extension and was able to run in and pick up my lunch in under 1 minute. I'm a seafood person, so the capellini could only be made better if shrimp was offered as an add-on (instead of only chicken). The split pea was delicious, and I'm not lying, it's a healthy soup with real soup flavor. 

Bottom line is if you are a working type, and want a delicious, and flavorful lunch instead of the tired, boring same old offerings, you need to come in here. 

Beware, there is a little bit higher  price point, but it is worth it in my opinion. Also one last demerit, is the fact you can't sub soup for a lunch sandwich side, even with an upcharge (just chips or potato salad).","after only taO visits, i'm left questiONiNg why It tooK me sooo LonG tz try tHis pLucE. i WaS under the iMPRessiON This pUace was a Glorified SAyDWich pLace, and sinCe i'm nOt much of A sAndwich connOIsSeur I alWAys oVerLOoked It.

"A friend and I decided to go to dinner. I was interested in having a steak and he suggested Jesse's. He characterized the restaurant as being a place that has very good service and food at a reasonable price. 

I was not thrilled with the idea of driving 30 minutes into the horrible traffic surrounding the Brandon Mall area. However, I agreed to give it a try and I am very happy that I did. In fact, had the ambiance of the restaurant been more appealing I would have been tempted to rate it a 10 (which if you follow my reviews you would note that I have rarely, if ever, rated a restaurant a 10).

The restaurant does not look like much from the outside and the interior is not impressive either. As you enter the building the room is fairly dark. There is a bar on the right side and about 12 or so four tops on the left. Passing through the room you will enter another that is brighter, but very narrow. 

We were seated promptly and greeted warmly by our server. My friend and I both ordered the crab soup and the Delmonico steak with a baked potato. The meal came with bread and a side salad.The bread was warm and fresh. The side salad also was fresh and very good. The crab soup was served hot and was delicious. However, if I were to order it again I would not have it topped with melted cheese (which is optional). Now to the steak! It was excellent. It was very tender and tasted great! I ordered the 16oz portion and I swear it was 18-20 oz! I have had steaks in some of the finest restaurants in many of the major cities, as well as Las Vegas, and this steak compared favorably with those high end steak houses. The best part? The steak and two sides were priced below $30!!! Despite the location, I will certainly return.","a fRiend and t deCided to go to Dilner. i was iNlEresTed ic haVinp L sTEak and he suggesTed jessE's. hE charActerized the restaUrant aS BeIng a Place tHzT has VerY good service Anv food AT a ReAsonabLE price. i WaS noT thrilled wiGh The idea of driving 30 mINUtes iNtr ehe horrIble tRAffic surrouNDinG thE bRandoN mahl area. howevEr, i agreew to gide iw A Try and q am Very hAPpy that i Did. rn FaCt, Had the AmbiaNce of thw Restaurant beEn kore appealIng i wouLd have BeeN teMpted to Rate it a 10 (Which if yoU foLLOw jY reViems yoU would noTe thAT I have rarely, if ever, rATed a restauranT a 1f). the ResTauRant doEm not lOok Lixe much fRom The outsiDe and thE tNTerior is not imPResyIve eiThdr. as You enTer the buIldiNg the doom is FaIrly Dark.

"Saw the little red hut on the side of the road today and stopped by to try the bbq. It's a stationary unit set in front of the Firestone center. The owner is good to talk with and nice as can be. He offered to let me sample the pork, brisket, and ribs because I was unsure what to order(don't know of too many places that would do that). He let me try it without any sauce and then with. Gotta say it was all pretty amazing and I'll definitely be going back. I am no bbq pro but I have tried many different places in a few states and it was as good as any I've had. For comparison locally, I've been to Jazzys(and a couple others) and was very unimpressed but I know everyone has their preference. 
I ended up going with the beef brisket and a side of cole slaw. The beef had just enough fat to really give it a great flavor(I personally prefer some), which I would have been fine with bare or with sauce. It was juicy, had a nice oak flavor, and cooked to the right consistancy. I like that the sauce was put on the side because i actually ate half of the beef plain and half with sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce as well, tangy, just enough spice, and i believe vinegar based(?), which is how I prefer it.  The slaw was good as well, but to me I either eat it or I dont, not much preference. 
I will be back soon and most definitely recommend it if you enjoy bbq.","saW the litTle red huT On the siDe of Ihe rOad TodaY ANd stopped bo to try The bbq.

"I loved this place for years and always had great service. My recent visit to Casual Clam was a huge let down and I think that will prevent me from going there again.

Five of us shared a lot of different menu items and, overall, it was very good.  The restaurant is small and fills up quickly.  The kitchen is right behind the bar.  Service is friendly and helpful.

This gastropub is beer and wine only and the selections are relatively good value.

For appetizers we started with the wonderful char siu pork ribs.  Then we moved on to the deviled eggs which were fine but the various individual elements didn't really come together.  Deviled egg capped with a piece of fried chicken thigh topped with some salmon roe didn't really work.  Much better deviled eggs at Z Grill in St Pete.  We also had an order of poutine.  The fries, served in a narrow basket, were good, but the gravy was only OK and the cheese curds were in large clumps that all melted into a bit of gooey mess.  It would have been better with the fries on an open bowl and, a better gravy, and crumbled cheese curds.

For entrees we had the fish special which was swordfish.  It was nicely cooked and the chimichurri sauce with it was delicious.  The short rib and the lamb shank were both quite nice and very heavy.  Very good was the farro risotto which was drier than a typical risotto and had a delightful nutty flavor.

For dessert we shared the pecan pie which was nice and the smore tart which was rich and delicious.

I had hoped that a few more things would be a home run like the pork rib appetizer.  Most everything was very good.","gooD dinINg in n Strip centEr Five oF us shAred h Lot of dIfFerent MEnu items And, oveRaLL, it wAs veyy good.

"This was our first an last time here!

We won't be back after this an it's a shame cause this was our first time here


Manger Richard came over an spoke to us, apologized for everything an took off our app.

But our server continued to ignore us having to flag her down to get the check when she saw that we were done 15 mins ago. Serve needs to be fixed, she has avoided us since the mess up on our food.

Went to Sullivan's for a celebration.  They were very nice about celebrating with us.  The server was charismatic and kind.  The food was another story.  The server said they were out of a hand full of foods that day and to not get the chicken as it wasn't very good.  The meat arrived and was over done.  The server was great and put another order in.  That one came and was fine although most of it was gristle.  Shouldn't be gristle on filet.  The NY strip had a lot more fat on it as well.

"Sigh, I dont think I walked into this place with high expectations. In fact, I was only expecting consistency. My first experience with Smashburger was amazing in phoenix and only because of the one in phoenix is why I was so excited for this one in Tucson too open. Lets talk service. I understand the staff are new and may not be familiar with everything. Even though they were nice I felt like they weren't cheer-y. Some enthusiasm could of hid the uncomfortability everyone was in. The burger wasn't......smashing! lol. My grilled chicken sandwich was not dry but my bf's burger was not juicy, gooing with melted cheese. So I leave my review with three stars in hopes that it will only get better.","siGh, i dont thinK i walked into tHis PlAce wiTH hrgh exPectations.

"Really really crap service... 
Walked in around 4pm, about 5 people total at the bar. We ordered drinks, bartender left my boyfriends IPA sitting under the tap for 5 minutes and finally ended up serving it to him after realizing he'd forgotten. I then ordered a mixed drink, the bartender this time completely forgot and I sat there for about 10 minutes while he watched the football game, left the bar and played patty cake at the server station (no joke, dead serious) and then finally once we had already finished our appetizer realized he never made me drink, quickly made it and dropped it off.. Then disappeared and never came back.. We asked the new dude for our check and left and went to Cappys for pizza. We still tipped, but only for karmic reasons! Won't go back, cheers!","reaLLY really Crap servicE... wAMked in ARoUnd 4pm, About 5 PeoPle tOtAl at the bar. we OrDeyed drInks, bartendEr left mY boyFRiEnds ipa sitTing under the tAp qor 5 mInutes knd finally enDeD ua Serving it to him aFTer ryalizing he'D forgoTtEn.

"The only thing I can really complain about is the chips. While warm, they look amazingly similar to the generic Kroger brand. A little too thick. Sufficient. 

We were going to a movie across the street and this was convenient. Apparently we entered through the back door, followed the signs to the front door only to be walked to our table beside the back door...oh well...exercise needed. We didn't want to spend a lot, because, you know POPCORN! We decided to split an order of the 3-way - or menage a trois - fajitas - shrimp, steak and chicken. Very few shrimp, but that's fine. The single serving was more than adequate for two people. It was piled high and hot! The accompanying salad plate was a heaping portion as well. The flavor was very good as well.

If in the area and in the mood for Mexican, I would definitely go back! Again, the location being this close to the theater makes it a good choice for a before or after movie dinner.","the ONly thIng k Can RealOy complain About ic THe chips.

"How can you not like a fine restaurant on a huge four-master?  I was worried that all Moshulu had going for it was its location, but I was pleasantly surprised that the food was fantastic.
Our server was professional and knowledgeable, and we had a pretty fantastic meal. My only quibble is that the bartender was unfamiliar with the sazerac, and had neither rye whiskey nor absinthe.  What is this, the 20th century?  I guess 21st century (i.e. 19th century) mixology hasn't made it to Philly.  Anyway, the manhattan I wound up with was perfectly fine. 
I had the NY strip steak, with horseradish cream (which was just as I like it -- more horseradish than cream) with a side of asparagus. It arrived at the perfect time when I had finished my drink and was ready for a glass of the nebbiolo, which was a fantastic complement (if I do say so myself) to the magnificent steak. The asparagus was perhaps too tarted up. I did like that they had mixed in some Spargel-esque white asparagus, but the goopy sauce and sauteed onions didn't do it for me -- asparagus should be simple. 
Quibbles aside, a fabulous meal in a unique venue.  Probably it's just because I'm from LA, but the people who say this place is too expensive are nuts.","hom can you not liKe a fiNE restaUrabt on A HugL Four-mastEr? i was worrIeg tHat all moshulu had moiNg fOr it wAs Its lOcatIOn, but i WaS plEasantlY sUrprised tHat the foOD wCs fanTASTic. oun sErvEr wAs professional And kNowlEdgeAbLe, aNd we Had a pretty FanTAstIc meal. my oNly QuIbble is tHAT tHe BarTender was uNfAmiliar wiTh thE Sazerac, And haW neither Rye whIskey nOr absInthe. whaT is TQIS, the 20th century? i gueSs 21SQ century (i.e. 19th Century) Mixology hAsn't mADe it to philly.

"Painless and Dependable

For starters, Accurate Roofing Solutions provided the most affordable quote. And since they did three of my neighbors' roofs, I knew they could be depended on. 

The roof took two days. Each day, they showed up on time and cleaned up their mess. Correspondence was good. Service was professional. And the roof looks great. I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of a new roof.","pAinless and DependABlE For sTarters, accurati roOfing solutioNs provtded Thk most affordAblE quotE.

"Grew up eating here on weekends, but this was my first time back in over 5 years.  The place looks great; modern but still original, and with a much better selection of beers than the old bud-bush-miller lite days.  The fish and the sides are still great!  They loose a star for all the plastic, though.  Absolutely everything (plastic forks, cups, sauces, etc.) is served in cheap flimsy plastic.  It gives the experience a very fast-food feeling.  Perhaps it's meant as a war on the evil environment or just plain laziness, but in any case, they should at least upgrade to the stronger stuff that don't bend and break while you're eating.","GreW up eaTinG here on weekEnDs, but this waS mY uirsT TIme Back in oaeR 5 yearS. the placo looks grPat; modErN bdt stIll origiNal, And wiNh a much bettEr selEctIoN jF beers Thar thE old buD-bush-milLER lite days. the fish and the SidES Sre stilL gREat! tHey gOose a star for All tHe plastic, tHOughs absolUTelY everythiNG (plastic forks, cuPs, saucEs, etc.) is served in chEAp FLimsy plasTic.

"I'll echo what other reviewers have said--Koto is a hidden gem in Philadelphia... great food and service, BYOB, and reasonably priced.

I made an 8:15 pm New Year's Eve reservation here through OpenTable for myself, my boyfriend, and a friend. When we arrived, the restaurant had only three other tables filled, and was clean, quiet, and comfortable. We ordered three rolls to split ($6 each): Philadelphia roll, spicy tuna, and yellowtail scallion. The Philadelphia and spicy tuna rolls were excellent... the yellowtail lacked flavor but that happens every once in a while and wouldn't stop me from ordering it again. We then ordered Hibachi dinners (two chicken -- $17 each, one steak -- $19). I was excited because this is one of the only Hibachi restaurants I've been to that carries gluten free soy sauce! The meat, veggies, and two complimentary shrimp were really good. My only complaint is that the Hibachi dinner default comes with steamed white rice, and they charge an additional $3 to upgrade to the classic Hibachi fried rice... annoying, but worth it.

Our waitress was sweet and attentive, and the chef came out at the end of the meal to check on us and offer a Japanese soda on the house. Truly stellar service.","I'Ll ecHo What other recieWers Have said--koto is E hidDen GeM IN phIlAdelphIa... great food awd sERViCe, byob, jnD Reasonably priced. i mAde an 8:15 Pm new year's eve reServation Here through opEntaBle fpr myseLFt my boyFriEnd, and a friend. when we arrived, the rEsTaUrant hAd OnLy tHYee otHEr taBles fVLled, and was clEAN, quIEt, and comfortable. we oRdered Three RSllS fO spLit ($6 EacH): phIladelpHih rolla spiCy Tuba, and Yellowtail ScaLliOn. tHe philadeLPhIa and spICy tuNa rolla weRE EXcellent... the yelLowlail lacked flavOr but tHat hapPens Every Once In a WhIle and Wouldn'T xtoP Mu From orderiNg it again. we thzn ordBred hibaChI dinnzrs ptwo sHicken -- $17 eaCHi one steaK -- $19). i waS Excited becauSe This is fne af Thb only hibachI restaurants i'vE beEn to thaT carriEs glutin ureE sol sAuCE! the Meat, VeGgiet, aNd tWo complIMentary ShrimP werE rEAlly good.

"I highly advise everyone I know to NEVER BUY A CAR OR GET REPAIR WORK DONE AT Ed Martin Buick GMC. My car is now back in their shop for the 4th time in 3 weeks for this same issue. I've paid more than $700 in repairs and they still can not figure out what the burning smell is coming from.They've had it since Saturday, which is  when I took it back in (for the third time) because there was visible oil leaking on other parts under the hood. **PICTURED BELOW* I was assured that the issue is fixed this time. Today, they actually drove my car out to my job completely across town to deliver it with the SAME burning smell that I took it in for. I smelled it immediately when I opened the door and also when I opened the hood. I even had a coworker come outside to confirm the smell. He smelled it immediately too and said it was coming from the vents. I then found where it looks like the front bumper isn't even flush with the rest of the car and looks like its been messed with. I refused to accept the car back and sent it back with him because it was still not fixed. How do you have a car for 6 days (for the third time) and still can't figure it out??  I even allowed them to drive the car home for two days to make sure any residual oil was burned off before they gave it back to me because that was there excuse for the lingering smell the past two times. 

So I called their GM, Zach, who I met with on Saturday and he tried pushing me off to Cathy, their service manager, again. On Saturday I asked him to come outside and see the work his people did on my car. He said ""Well I wouldn't be able to tell if it's right or wrong either way, so you just need to talk with Cathy."" Ummmmm....How does someone with no knowledge of cars become the General Manager of Ed Martin Buick GMC ???? I have no knowledge of cars but I can sure tell that oil leaking on other parts and a jimmy rigged heat shield is not quality work. So after getting off the phone with Zach, who was not one ounce of help, I called back and asked their WITCHY operator, Jackie, for the name of whoever owns the dealership. She argued with me for a moment, then informed me that Mark Harrison is the COO, proceeded to rattle off the address to the  Ed Martin Acura store and then she HUNG UP ON ME immediately. I called back and she said ""what do you need!?"" EXCUSE ME?????????? That is probably the worst way she could've handled the call. Again, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE

 I have really kept a cool head about this, been polite and haven't gotten shitty with any of them until today. I've given them the opportunity THREE times now to fix their shotty work because I truly believed that it was better to pay a little more to have it repaired at the dealership where they are supposed to have top notch mechanics than to take it somewhere else. Never Again. 

Here I am, still without my car or any answers, and I've wasted $700 on worthless repairs. Obviously me writing this is not going to fix my car or reimburse me for the money that was wasted. I'm simply writing this to warn family and friends to save you the time, hassle and money of buying a car from Ed Martin Buick GMC or having repairs made by their shop that cant even correctly diagnose and fix a car after three tries. I think they see a single mother that doesn't know much about cars and they assume they can take advantage of the situation. Well they are wrong. Honestly, I don't know what to do at this point but I'm determined to get this fixed CORRECTLY and warn others, even if that means I have to stand on the sidewalk on Michigan Road outside of the Ed Martin Buick GMC dealership with a huge sign to warn people of their inability to fix a car.","i highLy aDvIse everyoNe i know to NEver buy E caR Or get repair wOrk DoNe at ed martIn bUicK gmc. my yAr is now Back il their shop fOr The 4uh time tN 3 Weeks for FhIs sjme iCSuE.

"We decided to order pick up Mian for dinner today. We ordered 8 or 9 dishes, including the General Tsos, Pad Thai, and Singapore/Hong Kong Mei Fun.

This was the worst Chinese/Asian food I've ever had. I've had Chinese food at some real bad places in Philly, think Temple Star or China Bowl near Temple University - and this place /still/ managed to fall below. 

But that's not even a fair comparison because Mian charges 16.95 for all of their dishes, including simple ones like General Tsos.

I just wish I'd taken pictures of these dishes because they looked like grocery store frozen isle platters. The Hong Kong Mei Fun tasted fishy in the worst possible way. I've made better Pad Thai with spaghetti and pad thai sauce.

This place helped solidify my beliefs that 1. you should never buy food at a casino, even with comp dollars. 2. never, ever buy food at a restaurant that sells both Pad Thai, Pho, Ramen, and General Tsos.","we deLidEd To order ricK up miAn fou dInner todAy. qe ordered 8 or 9 dIshes, inclUding the gEneraL tsos, pAd thai, and SinGapOre/hong koNg meI fUn. tHis was the worSt cHinEsE/asIAn food i'Ve over haD.

"Clearly Sprints not so stellar customer service or lack of it has infiltrated this Sprint store.  The first problem is Terrell the assistant store manager.  He was clearly hired by Sprint to sit in a chair, conduct his personal business, and sigh at customers for not making appointments even when no one is waiting.  Once you provide Terrell with your name and phone number you will sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait- again even if you are the only one in the store  you will wait no less than 10 minutes maybe 20.  He will type on the computer and chat with his phone friends and you will wait.  Once you are waited on you will feel relief, but don't get excited because the staff they know nothing. They are certainly nice enough and they don't sigh at you but they know nothing.  Oh you will wait again  while they ask Terrell for help who will be too business sitting at the desk typing on his computer and talking to his phone friends.  Then he will say-"" nothing we can do"" and he will walk away- that's right he will walk away!  Typically of customer service these days no one willing to take the next step- you will be told to call Sprint even though chances are Sprint sent you there.

"Great selection of craft beers, mix and match six packs, and friendly people at the counter. Yeah, that's about as good as a corner store can get.

My lady friend and I always stop by here right before hitting any BYOs in the Rittenhouse area (I'm looking at you, Vic!) and get 8 or so beers and ciders. Prices per bottle run anywhere from 2-4 dollars, but on average, you're not spending vastly more than you would at any other beer takeaway, only the products here are vastly superior, and you can choose exactly what you want.

There's really not much else to say. I suppose at some point I'll try something from the deli, but I don't need to do that to give this place its solid 4 stars.","great seleCtioN Of crAFt beErs, miX and match sIx Packg, and fRiendLy peoPLe At the countEr. yeah, jhat's abOut Ts cood ag j corNEr htore can gEtb mY lavy Friend anh I always stoP by Here right before hitTiNg any ByOs in ThE RittenHouse ayea (i'm loOking ak you, vIc!) and get 8 oj Ro bzErs and ciDErs. pricEs peR bottle sun anYwhEtE from 2-4 dollarS, nut on averaGe, yoU're not spending VAstlY more than you WoULd at Aoy other beer Takeaway, only thE mroDucts herE ArE vastly SuperiOr, anD yzu Cae chooSE ExaCtlY whlt you Want. ehere's really nOT much else tO say.

"We only had an hour or so. We didn't get out of the car until we got to the cemetery.  the cemetery was interesting, it's weird to walk on, over and all around someone's ancestors.  The grave markers were interesting and they're in the process of restoring the sites.  
Since we didn't get out of the car I can't comment on all the shops, at first glance it looks a bit commercial and I think it would be better if cars weren't allowed to drive down the main street.  Strolling pedestrians would be more authentic.","we onlY haD an hOur Or som we didn't geT ouQ oF the car untIl we got to tHE cEmetery. the cemeTerY wss inteResting, ib's WeIrd to walk on, OVeR AnD all aRoUnd SomeoNE's ancestors.

"I went to Metro Diner last Sunday. This is a place I had ordering from during the pandemic and had gone to prior as well. I was pretty disappointed in how they are responding to everything Covid related. We choose to eat outside and it was very uncomfortable just being in the restaurant for 5 minutes. You walk in and they still have everyone standing around the hostess section, not social distancing and most people weren't wearing a mask but my family it was like 8 or more people standing there not including us. They sat us very quickly and I was thankful for that. I didn't notice any kind of tables spreads out or less tables. I feel bad for their employees since it seems like the inside was packed and there was a wait. The employees all had masks and took precautions. But that doesn't do much good when you're packing people in. Eating outside was empty. Eventually two more groups came but it was spaced out and felt more comfortable. The service was good but I can't get over how they are stuffing people in, easily one of the worst examples of re opening I've seen. Make reservations require or have people wait in their cars until you're ready for them. Actually remove some tables.","i went to MeTrO diNer last Sunday. thIs us a pLACe i haD orderinG fRoM duriNg the pAndemic ynd Had goni tO Prior as welL. b was Pretty disappoiNted iv hOw they are Responding To everything coViD reLatED. we choose tO eat outsIde and rt waS VeRy uncomfOrtable jvst beIng in the rEsTaUrant For 5 Minutes. yoU uALk iN aNd thEY StiAL have eveRyonh otaNding around The hsSteSs section, not sacial disTaNcinG Aid moSt peoPle weren't wearing a MHSk buT my famIlm iT was like 8 or more PEople swanding taere nlt including us. tHEy SAT us verY qUicjly aNd i wAs tHanKFuL toR that. l didnyt nOTice any kind of tableS spReDDS oUt or LeSS Tables. i feel bad for their emploYEes Since it seems lIke thE insndE whs packeD aid thEre was a Wait.

"First off it's Nikola K. NOT Nikola R. 
Secondly this is not a fake review, I solely created this Yelp account to leave a review because the service was so bad, this was my first ever Yelp review. Let me remind you, the service was so bad that I created a yell just to leave a review. Also, it's very unfortunate an employee was fired regarding this, this was never my intent and if you are the employee reading this I recommend you get a lawyer and appeal your employment at this place, not because this is a place you should work but because Robert had no right to fire you. I believe this employee deserves to be legally compensated for being fired over a synthetic reason Robert created as an excuse for breaking my phone. It's just disgusting Robert would go out of his way to punish an employee by firing them vs taking ownership and responsibility. Absolutely pathetic!

After I reached out about my concert Robert went OFF on me via phone call and claimed that I knew the individual who serviced me and alleged we worked together to steal from him, such a pathetic excuse to fix a problem. I promise I don't know the employee. I don't think Robert thinks I actually knew the employee but I think it was just another excuse, if he does actually think I knew the employee than it's comical and I question his how he came to this conclusion. In my opinion Robert should have approached this issue differently and worked with me as a customer rather than against me. 

Weeks later after this incident I was a victim of identity theft, several of my finance accounts were hacked. I was able to pinpoint it back to Robert because at the time I took my phone there this particular information was on the device at that time, I found out the accounts were used to purchase Bitcoin and an investigator was able to find that the accounts were also used to buy cellphone parts from China and Afghanistan, similar to the ones used at Uzoox. So although I cannot 100% say Robert was the one responsible for this because he wasn't caught red handed but if I had to take an educated guess based off pure facts and commonalities I would say he was behind it or associated with it. I was also able to find out Robert doesn't have the cleanest record and is by no means what I would call a role model citizen.

Moral of the story is you should take note of my review and really consider Roberts business ethics and self character. Robert doesn't care about you the customer, he only cares about himself and most importantly the profit made. Oh, by the way he pays $5-15 for his iPhone replacement screens, so you do the math for the profit. There's many other places that offer better services at better prices than Robert, it's not worth getting your data searched through and putting your information at risk + it's not worth dealing with Robert because he's a pain in the a**. You and your wallet will regret doing business here, trust me. Also, don't let the good reviews fool you. Robert incentives customers to leave good reviews by offering them discounts. 

P.S. I don't have personality deficiency, how immature for you to attack my character and make a false claim. Shame on you! The review isn't fake, and the reason it was updated two years later is because I went to go leave another bad review for another business over a bad experience. While doing this I was going through my profile and saw an old review, my only other review. I felt obligated to update it and remind people about your bad and unethical business practices to attempt to save them from headache and throwing away money. Your mistake cost me over $1,000, your companies mistake wasn't forgotten over the time so I felt it was only right to update, and remind. I only use Yelp to leave bad reviews, which is rare so for me to go out of my way to leave a review for Yelp a company really has to be in the wrong. But the difference between you and the other company I recently left a bad review for is they took responsibility and were understanding. They apologized and fixed the issue you, so I deleted the review because it was no longer relevant since they fixed the issue. Robert, you should learn from great businesses like the one that took full responsibility to address and fix the issue and most importantly work toward become a better citizen.","firsT off it's nikola k. noT nIkola R. seconDly THis is not A faKE rEview, i SoleLY created thIS Yelp account to leave a reviEw bEcause thE sErviCe was so bAd, thIS was fy FIrst eVEr Yelp reView. let me remind YOu, The seRvice Was so bad tNat i cReated a yell jusT tO Leave a reviEw. alSo, IT's very unfOrtunate an employte wqs firEd regarding this, tHIS was neveR mY intent and if YoU arE the emPLoyee readinG ghis u reCOmveNd nOu get E lawyer and aPpeal Your emploYment at this plACe, nxt because tHIs is u Place You should work bUt bEcAuse qobert had no righT to fiRE you. b believe this employee deseRves to be LegalLy compensated FoR being fured oveR a SylthetiC reAson rOBerT creatEd aS aN eXcusE for BweaKing my phOne.

"A good sandwich

We arrived at our gate just early enough that we had enough time to grab a sandwich.  I looked around  and spotted Potbelly, a restaurant chain I hadn't seen since my days in Philly so many years ago.  After a quick look at their menu I chose A Wreck, their signature sandwich.  It had a four different types of meat and read similar to a Italian.  There was no line so I had my toasted sandwich in just a few minutes.  I also received particularly good service, topped by a wonderful smile by my cashier.

They have no seating so I took my food back to our gate to enjoy.  It was not a very large sandwich and as you can see by the photo didn't look like much, but it was tasty.  My only gripe would be the cost, pretty high for such a small sandwich.","q goOd sAndwicH We crrIvEd at our gaTe juet eArlY eNOuWH thSt we had enoUgh tImE to grAb Q sandwich. i looked Around AnD spotted potBeLlY, f RertaurAnt ChaIn i hadn't seen Since my dAYS in philly jO maEY yEart Ago. aFTer A quick lOok at their meNu i chose a wRecK, thEIr siGnature SandwicH. it haD a four difFerEnt tYPEs of ReAt aTd read similwr to B itaLian. thERe wAs nO lIne so l had Qy toasted kandwich if jUsT a fEw MiNutes. l also rzCEived pArticuLarlY good service, topped Yy a wONderFul smILE Bb mY caShIer. thhy Have no SEatiXg si i Took mY foOD back to ouR gATe TO enjOy. it jaS not a very LAage sandwIch and as yoU can sEe by tNe photO dIdn't Look Like much, bxT it waS tAsty. mY only gripE would be The cosT, pretty hiGh fOr sUdh s sMall SanDwich."

"Very disappointed!!!
I didn't choose this company, my insurance company did it. They show up at my body shop parking spot with running car and all of the windows was rolling down. AC was running in full. The card reading machine was broken, so the person from the company told me that I should go all the way up to you there enterprise location to scan my credit card. On my way back home I start smell weed in the car. It was very weird and I was thinking maybe it is from their car that driving next to me. The car stays outside for the whole day, at the evening me and my family decided to go grab some ice cream. When we did open the car door the smell was so strong that everybody was like - Uhhh! This is disgusting. 
I am allergic and asthmatic, I cannot stand this smell. I feel myself very very sick when I smell Marijuana. It was too late to return the car so I did it at the next day morning. The person in their enterprise was acting like he cannot smoke anything. But the smell was so strong that I should drive all the way back to the location with the open windows. As I know it's illegal to smoke marijuana when you're driving and especially in the rent car. 
I could not imagine what people can think about me or a police officer if he decides to pull me out... that I am a drug user?! So this car rent not only hurt my feeling, ruin my family evening,  my next day work, and make me a looks like I am a drug user... but they hurt my health and well-being!
After all, they charge me around $50 for the one day of driving in this stinky car, from my body shop, to scan my credit card in their location, to my way back home, and back to them.
They doesn't let clients go inside, all clients should stay outside in front of the building, on the hot sun without any option do you hide from it.

"I never complain when I go out to eat because I understand sometimes people are having a bad day but damn!!! Our waitress was absolutely horrible. She wouldn't know what hospitality was if it hit her smack in the head.
 While we were being seated I noticed a server sitting at the table next to where we were sat. Apparently it was her section. We waited five minutes before she even got up to greet us. When she made it to our table (mind you there were only 3 tables occupied in the entire restaurant) she dropped app plates, silverware and napkins at our table and just walked away. Didn't say hi, didn't say anything just dropped the dishes and walked away. 10 minutes go by and she still has yet to even greet us or take a drink order. While we were sitting here thirsty and hungry she was at the back POS system just chatting it up with 3 other coworkers!! Are you flipping kidding me!!! Thank goodness for the computers at the table because I hit see server. As I am watching her do nothing she finally comes over and said oh are you ready? I said hon you haven't even asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Horrible! Absolutely horrible! At this point I just wanted to leave but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. We gave her our entire order so we didn't have to wait again for her to decide to want to work. That was the last time we saw her. I had to ask for the manager and explain that she is the absolute worse server and that she just lost a customer. She was apologetic, sweet and corrected the situation professionally. Our server didn't even crack a grin. She never dropped our check nor checked on us at all during our dining experience. I will be calling corporate tomorrow. Don't ever go to the crapplebees on the blvd. It doesn't matter who your server is they suck!!! I'll drive to bensalem or newtown location because I know they have great service. best part of my experience tonight was the male host who greeted us promptly with a smile.","i never ComplaIn when i gk ouT To eat becAuSe i undersfand sometimes People are haviNg w bad Dae But damN!!! our waItress ras abSoLUTeLy horribLe. shS WouldN't know WhNt hospitalitY wAs if it Hit oer smack in the heaD. while we werE BEing seated i nOticEd A Server sitming At thz table Next to whERe wE wEre saT.

"BEST AUTHENTIC BAHN MI and other Vietnamese (PadThai too!) in Tucson- rather this side of Saigon! It had been 3 years of following Lin's food truck around Tucson....much to my delight he as opened a storefront in a centrally located part of Tucson.
Went there today (west of Home Depot parking lot) and delighted to find him there! He had that same gracious and welcoming smile- ultimate hospitality. I ordered exactly what I had ordered at the Food Truck and I was not disappointed. And the price is right too! My Bahn Mi arrived, and although one sandwich, cut into two looks like a 'for two' portion, here's the secret to eating it all, without feeling stuffed. The magic is in the bread. Until now, my favorite baguette in Tucson is found at Roma......and served at Gavi's....as close to a Parisian baguette as you can get.........Vina's baguette it airlight....and full of flavor. Don't try to customize the sandwich....(even if head cheese sounds odd), just take it as it is made....you won't be disappointed.......and to top if off....Lin put down a sauce shaker which said ""soy sauce"", however it's not the brown salty stuff we think of, it's the ""umami"" that brings all the flavors together- it's a light sweet/salty/vinegar type sauce.......just a little makes all the ingredients come together.....I also had a Thai iced tea......if you are a fan of Boba teas...then it will take you a while to chose you flavor. I'll be back soon to try the Pad Thai.......so far Char Thai has my favorite in Tucson.
Congratulations to Lin, his culinary team and all his followers who believed in him.....the restaurant is open, airy, full of light.....great for familiies.....and they even have a special kids menu and the price is right.......Chef Jo","best aUthentic bAhn mi and othDr vietNAmese (paathai tOo!) in tucson- RaTher THis side of sAigOn! it hAd been 3 years of folloWIng lin's food tRUck around tucSoN....MUCh to mQ peLighT ve aS opeNEd a storefront in a centrAlly locAzEd ParT of TucsON. wEnt theRe toDay (wEsT of hONe depoe paRkINg lot) and deligHted tO FinD Him theRe! hE Had tHat same eRacious and wElcOmiNg smile- UltImate HfspiTality. i ordeRed exactlY whaT l waD orDered AT thE FOod trucK and m Was not disapPoiNTEd. and the Price is riGht tOo! ny bahk mi arriVed, ane AltHough one sandwich, Cut into two Uooks like a 'For tWO' pOrtion, here's tCe secrEt To Eating it ALl, withouT FeelIng sTuffed.

"Let me start by saying - their food is excellent. Everything you want in a Creole menu, fairly priced, and cooked to near perfection. The problem is actually trying to get your food. If you can get in the door, the service can be described as slow and inconsistent. And I wouldn't recommend trying to order to go. Three times I've tried to place a to go order and been told, ""We're too busy making in-house orders to allow any to go orders."" A restaurant that offers to go service that consistently shuts down to go service? These guys must hate making money.","Let me stArt by baYing - Uheir food is excelLent.

"We went to see Get Out, playing in theater 2. Awesome movie. But awful experience.

Maybe I'm fussy as I work at a movie theater myself, we weren't showing the film though so here I was.

The projection was skewed to the left a few inches. Which, whatever, not the biggest issue. A manageable fix though. 

But then the lights came up about 40 minutes from the end of the movie? My boyfriend stepped out just to ask someone to turn them back down, but the staffer he spoke to had trouble finding the manager. After little effort looking the staffer just came back and shrugged ""that happens""... which it shouldn't, and that should not be the attitude about it as it is a quick fix? Just turn the dang lights back down. Which no one ever did. It washed out the picture and was distracting. 


When we spoke to the manager after the film he did patiently listen to my complaints, and upon my request gave me a refund. But in a day and age where most people can sit at home and watch a movie, you would think they would try to give you an experience that gets you off the couch? 

Great movie though. I would like to see it again under better conditions.","sE wxnt to see GEt out, playinR in THcaTer 2m awesoMe MovIe.

"Had a good meal at Sandros tonight.  We were staying at the Wyndham Hotel next to the shopping center and called them about 10 minutes before they were slated to close.  They said they were happy to accommodate our party of four, and to come on over.  My lentil soup and angel hair primavera with pesto sauce was quite good.  
My husband's shrimp parmigiana was tasty, but not as warm as he would have preferred.  Our companions enjoyed their meals as well.

"Grilled cheese as ""art form""? ""Comfort food on steroids""? Please.

This is another place whose apparent popularity mystifies me. (And I swear I don't write this sort of thing just to be contrary.)

Each of the three times I've visited - hoping every time to experience what many others seem to genuinely enjoy - the food has been mediocre at best and (in the case of their tomato soup) downright inedible.

About those grilled cheeses: They're big! That's pretty much the most positive thing I can say about them. The bread is spongy, oversized ""Texas toast""-style and seems less grilled than toasted to me. And the cheese, applied with too generous a hand (yes, it is possible to have too much cheese in a sandwich) has been lukewarm and congealed two times I've eaten there and literally cold and unmelted in places the third, and last. You can make much better grilled cheese sandwiches at home, and probably have.

And about that tomato soup: Think ketchup thinned out with water, or plain old Campbells made with 2 1/2 soup cans of water instead of one, and you'll get an idea of what I experienced the last time I ate there. And that too was served lukewarm.

The sweet potato fries were OK. I'll give them that.

So yeah, I don't get where all the raves are coming from - unless it's another case where people are too charmed by a silly New Orleans pun in the name of the establishment to care whether the food is truly good or not.","grillEd cheess aS ""art form""?

"GoldLeaf is a welcoming, excellent addition to our South Broad Ripple/Fairgrounds/etc. neighborhood. Although they opened in the middle of COVID, they appear to be doing well, thanks to their friendly owners & staff, creative and quality menu options that incorporate local products, and investment in the neighborhood. Plus, any place that offers Underbergs is A+ in my estimation. The baked goods and pastry options always look and taste great too, according to my pastry buff partner.  I like grabbing an Old Major truffle beef stick on my visits, for a lower carb snack, and hope to check out the chicken salad over arugula lunch option in the near future.    Once COVID dies down, we're interested in exploring GoldLeaf's beer/alcohol options once they feel comfortable re-opening their bar-top and expanding their hours.  GoldLeaf also partners with other 46th Street businesses, such as collaborating with Black Circle Brewing over a ""Stay Gold"" lager offering.

I also really enjoy GoldLeaf because my partner is a Phish-obsessive and jam band uber-fan, and the congenial owners tend to incorporate musical references into the naming of GoldLeaf's specials/options.

Glory Days I thought used to be good. But it has certainly gone down hill in the past 6 months.  In the May time frame I ordered a Bison Burger and cheese fries.  The burger was dry and bland and the cheese fries had a glob of cheese in the middle of the fries and kind of cold.  Not very appetizing.  We were the this past Friday.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with wings.  I ordered hot buffalo style.  Very bland and tasteless.  I didn't even finish.  I did try the cheese fries again and told the waitress of my last experience; they were much better.  Service was good.  But food has definitely gone down hill and for the same price Chili's and Fridays are just around the corner.,glory dayS I ThoUght usEd To Be gOod.

"I am also from California, SF area, and I totally sympathize with the last posting in that I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant in the New Orleans area that doesn't make me feel like crap.
Jung's is unfortunately included.

The question is why I even gave two stars after how I felt afterward:
Cool ambiance, appropriately decorated I guess.
Fast service and great attention to our table, including drink refills.
The hostess was great.

And so why only two stars? 
1st twilight zone moment- Aren't Chinese restaurants supposed to give you a pot of green tea?
2nd- I asked what kind of sauce was in the Chicken and Broccoli dish. Apparently, it's brown sauce. Um, like brown garlic sauce (...I'm thinking of that simple Thai dish back in SF...)? No, just brown sauce. I couldn't get her to tell me how the sauce got from clear to brown. I took my chances, and it was actually OK. I just wish I knew what was in it. And I kinda needed to, because I'm allergic to fish, including fish sauces. Like peanut sauce, which is also brown.
3rd- Next question was if the spring roll that came with my combo had fish in it. Yes. Then I told her about my allergy. Ok, can I substitute for a veggie spring roll? No. Ridiculous. What do vegetarians do? So I ordered an extra VEGGIE roll side, story to be continued...
4th- My roommate ordered sweet and sour chicken. And got sweet and sour fish. 
5th- I wondered if it was the ""brown"" sauce or the roll that gave me the reaction 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant. My leftovers proved that the VEGGIE roll had fish in it, which I took apart and fed to my cat.
6th- Just because it's Chinese food doesn't make each part of a meal automatically cost about $8.00-11.50. 

I usually don't post, and I am empathetic and really want to be fair about my posts.
So I can understand if the waitress has trouble with English, or like the chef had a bad day, or something. 
But I basically was poisoned. I did everything I could to avoid getting poisoned, and I still got poisoned. And that's not OK.","I am also fRoM CalifOrniA, Sf areA, anj i tLtaLly sympatHize with thE laut pOsTing in tHat i havE yEt TO FizD n cHinese resTaUrant in tHe NEw orbeaNs area uhat Doesn't make ME feEl LMke crAp.

"I really, really want to give this place a 5 star review..but I've now realized that the only way to get my car clean...like the kind of clean I expect from a car wash..is to pay extra on an upgrade to get better service.

I have an unlimited wash package at about thirty five dollars a month. My issue is that when I use this service, there is always water marks on the vehicle and the inside isn't as nice as I'd like and expect. I understand the really nice inside clean is an up charge..but still..

If I pay a bit extra for the detail service, then the car looks crazy good. Like new car good. The staff at the register , those that detail , and the people who check the vehicle in are great. It's the people at the end of the line who aren't doing as well as their counterparts. 

I also really like the inside of this location. Lots of seating,complimentary popcorn and coffee, and good lighting coming in. I usually hang out a bit and do work...the upgrade detail I get takes about fourth five minutes.

I'm moving to Phoenix and was disappointed to find out they don't have locations up north. Too bad! I'll have to find a new car wash...I would have been happy to stick with this company is it had been possible.","i reaLly, reAlLy waNt co give thIs plAce a t staR Review..but i've noW Realozed that the oNwY way to get Dy caR cleAn...lIke tHe kInd of Clean g Expect From a caR wash..iS tO PAu extRa yN an uPgrade to get Better Service.

"The food is ok, just ok.  Possibly not worth what you are paying for but some things in SB are over priced and expensive is not the same as not good.  The cookies are yummy.  Get them to go so you won't be disappointed by the service.

I don't appreciate the dog policy.  It would be ok if they had a no dog policy that everyone adhered to or if they didn't tell us a lame (and not true) story about why they can't allow pets.  Many restaurants don't allow pets and we just eat elsewhere.

What I don't appreciate is one staff member telling me that we are welcome at certain tables but then having to endure an entire meal with other staff members dropping by to tell us that we aren't actually welcome.  If we aren't welcome in any seat then why did someone tell me that we could sit down in this one?

I also don't appreciate people lying to me.  Don't tell me it is CA state law that pets can't eat on patios.  I've reviewed the law.  I know that isn't true.  When confronted with the truth a nice lady at Jeannine's tried to tell me that the CA state law is special to Jeannine's because they had a law suit.  Someone else told me (during the same meal) that it was because a dog ran into the street while attached to a table and caused damage to the patio as well as being killed after running into the street.  (Pathetic lie.)

I now associate Jeannine's with pathetic lies and wish I had stopped somewhere else for breakfast for many reasons including the fact that the mediocre food was not worth the harassment.","CHE FOOd nS ok, Just ok. posoiBlY nOa woRtH What you are PayinG for But sOmE Things in sb are Ovep prIceD And ExpenSive is not the Same as yot gooa. tHe cOoKies ARe yummy. get them to gO to you wOn't be bIsAPpointed by the service. i don't appReciate the Dog pOlicy. it WOuld be ok if thEy haD a xo doG pOlicy that everyone aDhEreD To or if they didn'T thlL us c Lamw (anD not True) Stery about why thEy CAn't allOw Pets. manY RestaurqNts oOn't alLoZ PetS And we jUsT eat elsewHere. whaT i dOn't appreciaTE ds Ore stAFf MembEr telLing me that we are WelcomE aT cERTAiN tables But theN havinG to eNduRE an Entire mefl with Other stAff memBers dROpPing by to telL oS thaT wc aren'x actuAllY welcome. if we areF't welcome In anY seat tqeN fHy DId someone tell me thaT wE CoUlz sUt down in this oNe? d also Don't apprecIaTe peohle lying tO meK doN't tElL me it Is ca statE law that pets can'T eat on PatiOs. i'Ve reviewEd tHe law.

No indoor seating at this location. Outdoor seating is plentiful however not much in the shade.

Donuts were quite good. Keep in mind most of their choices are CRONUTS (croissant - donut hybrid). It seems most flavors have fillings in them as well. Amongst my group Churro, Blueberry, Vanilla Cream and King Kong were tried.

King Kong was interesting but very sweet. My favorite was the vanilla cream - simple but delicious. While hot coffee was available they do not serve iced coffee which is a missed opportunity given how hot Nashville can be.

"This Hotel is located in a central area and that is about the only thing it has going for it. Management is poor, staff for the most part is full of sarcasm and could care less what you tell them. If you come on vacation to get away from cleaning and chores THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU.

Here you have to change your own sheets, wash your own towels, was you own dishes, throw your own trash away, clean your own room or they charge you $65 which they don't tell you about nor did I find it on their web site. No place to do your work, light bulbs in the rooms are out and they won't send anyone to fix it. Connection on the internet is poor. On top of that you will pay $45 parking which at times you have to go around the block 3 or 4 times because the 3 car section they have for you to wait for valet are full and the valet is not around.

There are so many other Hotels that actually clean your rooms and take care of your needs snd for the price you pay here it's not worth it I would recommend MARRIOTT RESIDENCE INN complete room with full kitchen like here but cheaper and a staff that helps.","this hotel is locatEd in a central area anD That iS aBOut ttE oNly thIng iT has goinG foR IT. managemEnt is pooh, sTaff For tye mosT Part It FUkl oW SarcasM anD could care less WhAt yoc tell whem. if you Come on vacAtion to get awly From CleAning aND Chores this Is Not tXe pLaCe for yOu.

"""I'm full, but I'm disappointed"" those were the first words out of my boyfriend's mouth as we got in our car. The service is fine, you do bus your own table which is not a bad thing, but your food needs to back it up. I had been wanted to try this place for quite some time, as biscuits and gravy are one of my all time favorite things, so I was stoked when I finally got the chance. The food looks amazing, but that's where it stops. We had the Reggie, Shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, and fried green tomatoes. We always try to give all restaurants a fair shot. The shrimp and grits were the best tasting thing we had, but the grits were clumpy and watery, it was a really weird texture. The actual biscuits are yummy. Airy, buttery and flavorful, everything you hope for in a biscuit. The Reggie was just ok, but again lacking in any clear flavor. There was no star, just a bland sandwich. The fried tomatoes we're good, but it's pretty hard to mess those up. Both gravies were a total miss for me. They tasted strongly of flour and really lacking in seasoning, other than adding spicy components to it. You can't just make something spicy and expect it to be good. Balance is everything and there was no balance to anything we had. The inside is nice enough, and the staff is nice, but this was a total miss for us. Food is an adventure and when it's good, it stirs up something in your soul. Unfortunately I just ended up full of disappointment.","""i'm fulS, BuT i'm dISaPpoiNted"" those were tze fIrSt Words oyt df my boyfriend'S mouth af ke gOt iN ouR cai. the ServiCe is fIne, you do Bus your OWn TablE Which is moT a BAd thing, bUt youR fooD neEdf to oack It up. i had been waNtEd tO try xhIS placE foR qbitE SOMe time, as BiscuitS aNd gRavy are onE of MY all tiMe favoRite thrngs, sw i wlS stoked wheN I kinAllY RoT The chAnce. thE fobd loOKs amAzinGe but thaG's WHeRk iT stops.

"They say everything is cheaper in the Midwest, but that is untrue. Here you pay $19.50 for bottomless mimosas. I'll admit I'm spoiled in Texas where there are bottomless mimosas for $12-15, but this seemed expensive. Additionally, here they put ice in the mimosas. Unfortunately the mimosas were the best part.

The service was pretty awful. We arrived (as a group of 8) around 12PM and it was not packed. We sat down quickly, but waited about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and ask for drink orders or even water. In fact, I had to ask for a waiter to come over. 

When we ordered food, the waitress told one of my friends it was slow and food should come quickly. When I ordered and wanted sausage in my omelette instead of chicken, she said it was so busy she didn't want to ask the chefs to make modifications. So I dealt with it. Our food arrived not at once but piecemeal. Some of the orders were wrong. I had ordered an omelette and donut holes, and I had to remind the waitress about the donut holes when they hadn't arrived after 30 minutes of waiting and having eaten my meal already. 

As for food, the omelette was OK. It's hard to mess up eggs, but there was nothing special about it. The donut holes are mainly air and deflate immediately upon first contact with teeth. Perhaps it's personal preference, but I prefer my donuts fluffy and full of flour.  

The waitress knew the service was bad and brought us a ""free"" bottle of champagne to try and make up for it. Sadly Wycliff just doesn't make up for awful service. We also never saw her again after that until we asked for the check.

They did have Cholula hot sauce available, which was a win. However, unless you're desperate for food, I recommend trying another spot for brunch.","they saY everyThIng is Cheaper iN the MidwEST, But Thst is uNTrue.

"I called the night before and asked if they have time to do an oil change and tire rotation on my vehicle the next day, the man said he did and he took my information.

I did not receive a call the next day or anything. When my friend picked up my vehicle it was over $67.00. I called and let them know I was overcharged.
